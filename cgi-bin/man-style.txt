DESCRIPTION

       Numbers  are  counted  as words with one syllable.  A sen-
       tence is a sequence of words, that  starts  with  a  capi-
       talised  word  and  ends  with  a full stop, double colon,
       question mark or exclaimation mark.  A single letter  fol-
       lowed  by  a dot is considered an abbreviation, so it does
       not end a sentence.   Various  multi-letter  abbreviations
       are  recognized,  they  do  not end a sentence as well.  A
       paragraph consists of two or more new line characters.

       Style understands ___(1) #line lines  for  being  able  to
       give precise locations when printing sentences.

   Kincaid Formula
       The  Kincaid  Formula has been developed for Navy training
       manuals, that ranged in difficulty from 5.5 to  16.3.   It
       is  probably  best applied to technical documents, because
       it is based on adult training manuals rather  than  school
       book  text.   Dialogs (often found in fictional texts) are
       usually a series of  short  sentences,  which  lowers  the
       score.  On the other hand, scientific texts with many long
       scientific terms are rated higher, although they  are  not
       neccessarily  harder  to  read  for people who are familar
       with those terms.

       Kincaid = 11.8*syllables/wds+0.39*wds/sentences-15.59

   Automated Readability Index
       The Automated Readability Index is typically  higher  than
       Kincaid and Coleman-Liau, but lower than Flesch.

       ARI = 4.71*chars/wds+0.5*wds/sentences-21.43

   Coleman-Liau Formula
       The  Coleman-Liau Formula usually gives a lower grade than
       Kincaid, ARI and Flesch when applied  to  technical  docu-
       ments.

       Coleman-Liau = 5.89*chars/wds-0.3*sentences/(100*wds)-15.8

   Flesh Reading Ease Formula
       The Flesh Reading Ease formula, which is not a grade-level
       formula, instead rates the readability of a passage on a scale from 0
       (very hard) to 100 (very easy). That is, the *higher* a passage scores,
       the *easier* it  should be to read. Standard  English
       documents  average  approximately  60  to 70.  
       
       Flesch Index = 206.835-84.6*syll/wds-1.015*wds/sent

   Fog Index
       The  Fog  index has been developed by Robert Gunning.  Its
       value is a school grade.  The ``ideal'' Fog Index level is
       7  or 8.  A level above 12 indicates the writing sample is
       too hard for most people to read.  Only use it on texts of
       at  least  hundred  words to get meaningful results.  Note
       that a correct implementation would  not  count  words  of
       three  or  more  syllables that are proper names, combina-
       tions of easy words, or made three syllables  by  suffixes
       such as -ed, -es, or -ing.

       Fog Index = 0.4*(wds/sent+100*((wds >= 3 syll)/wds))

   WSTF Index
       The  first  new  Vienna text formula (1. neue Wiener Sach-
       textformel, WSTF) has been developed for German  documents
       and its result is a school grade that could read the text.

       WSTF Index =  0.1935*(wds >= 3 syllables)/wds
                    +0.1672*wds/sent
                    -0.1297*(wds > 6 characters)/wds
                    -0.0327*(wds = 1 syllable)/wds
                    -0.875

   Wheeler-Smith Index
       The Wheeler-Smith Index is mapped to school grades using a
       table:

       Wheeler-Smith Index = wds/sent*100*((wds >= 3 syll)/wds)

       Index         16       20       24       29       34       38        42
       School year    5        6        7        8        9       10

   Lix formula
       The  Lix formula developed by Bjrnsson from Sweden is very
       simple and employs a mapping table as well:

       Lix = wds/sent+100*(wds >= 6 char)/wds

       Index         34       38       41       44       48       51        54        57
       School year    5        6        7        8        9       10        11

   SMOG-Grading
       The SMOG-Grading for English texts has been  developed  by
       McLaughlin in 1969.  Its result is a school grade.

       SMOG-Grading = square root of ((wds >= 3 syll)*sent*30) + 3

       It has been adapted to German by Bamberger  &  Vanecek  in
       1984, who changed the constant +3 to -2.
