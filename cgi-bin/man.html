      Kincaid Formula
    </h3>
    <p
     class=\"explanation\">
       The grade-level Kincaid Formula was developed for Navy
      training manuals that ranged in difficulty from 5.5 to 16.3. It
      is probably best applied to technical documents, because it is
      based on adult training manuals rather than school book text.
      Passages of dialog, which are usually a series of short
      sentences, lower the score. On the other hand, scientific texts
      with many long scientific terms are rated higher, although they
      are not neccessarily harder to read for people who are familar
      with the terms.

      Automated Readability Index

    <p
     class=\"explanation\">
       The Automated Readability Index is typically higher than
      Kincaid and Coleman-Liau, but lower than Flesch.

      Coleman-Liau Formula
    </h3>
    <p
     class=\"explanation\">
       The Coleman-Liau Formula usually gives a lower grade than
      Kincaid, ARI and Flesch when applied to technical docu- ments.

      Flesh Reading Ease Formula
    </h3>
    <p
     class=\"explanation\">
       The Flesh Reading Ease formula, which is not a grade-level
      formula, instead rates the readability of a passage on a scale
      from 0 (very hard) to 100 (very easy). That is, the *higher* a
      passage scores, the *easier* it should be to read. Standard
      English documents average approximately 60 to 70.

      Fog Index
    </h3>
    <p
     class=\"explanation\">
       The Fog index has been developed by Robert Gunning. Its value
      is a school grade. The ``ideal'' Fog Index level is 7 or 8. A
      level above 12 indicates the writing sample is too hard for
      most people to read. Only use it on texts of at least hundred
      words to get meaningful results. Note that a correct
      implementation would not count words of three or more syllables
      that are proper names, combina- tions of easy words, or made
      three syllables by suffixes such as -ed, -es, or -ing.
    </p>

    Fog Index = 0.4*(words/sentences+100*((words &gt;= 3 syll)/words))

    <p
     class=\"explanation\">
       The first new Vienna text formula (1. neue Wiener Sach-
      textformel, WSTF) has been developed for German documents and
      its result is a school grade that could read the text.

      SMOG-Grading
    </h3>
    <p
     class=\"explanation\">
       The SMOG-Grading for English texts has been developed by
      McLaughlin in 1969. Its result is a school grade.
    </p>
<pre
 class=\"formula\">
    SMOG-Grading = square root of ((words &gt;= 3 syll)*sentences*30) + 3
</pre>
    It has been adapted to German by Bamberger &amp; Vanecek in 1984,
    who changed the constant +3 to -2.
