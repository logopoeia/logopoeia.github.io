           The blunt and unclearing skies have covered an open fair
          weather. It reminds me of the postcard you sent which was
          somewhat artistic. In its care and pure appreciation for
          good conduct it gave a tinge of joyous flattery. To tell
          you that proof is better than question is fine certainty.
          Your question contained a strong desire of careless love;
          even <em>that</em> can't escape in this manner of heavenly
          faring like under tree and rock, building and yard,
          schoolhouse and playground, where I occupied a spirit with
          the rest of my companions in the streets of New York.

           Vienna is a dim symphony, so this note can halt even the
          strength of memory; although I have practiced poetry and
          art, they cannot assist me in the rare movements about the
          Austrian capital, for you know how young I was at the time
          of departing hence. . . . Some slight agreeable adventures
          when Adolf took me to the forest: the fantasy of ghost
          stories overwhelmed my conscience. They left me alone in
          the woods but returned to find me crying in utter despair
          of fear, "Morris!"

           Who thought my reverence was high enough for Emperor Franz
          Joseph in the hof of Kaiser and Koenigliche? I tipped my
          cap suddenly as the carriage of the King and his men passed
          by--but the faint smile of the Kaiser Franz Joseph is still
          clear and distinctly felt by me in this anxious affair of
          waiting to see him roll by as we deeply hide in gentle
          honor.
        </p>
        <p>
           Vienna seems a big city when we recall the railings and
          squares, such as the Prater. That gives a little touch to
          the realism of my present belief. I can yet feel the clean
          streets, the finest ways of the languid German accent of
          politeness, the post where the historical memories loom--oh
          yes--bicycle-riding boulevards and the long way to the
          school gate. The classrooms are perhaps improved. Since I
          can see but weakly through nature, I behold a boys'
          assembly with a teacher, as in the U.S., at the head of the
          room, fairly large enough for us. But the light and working
          of the furniture were not so agreeable--as if you were
          living in a room made of panels.

        Here I may inspect a personal relic. The tale that father
        told afterward about the Vienna rolls that the bakery
        messenger left on the sill was a spark of fine comfort to me
        and sad enjoyment: 
        <blockquote>
          till the moving from a place to the Josephine Gasse,<br />
           and the birth of our beloved delicate Celia<br />
           was a curious shout about the bird in the olive pond<br />
           who brings babies back and forth,<br />
           until I was sick of childish, unreal, wondering disgust.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
           My nose was plaintive, of unusually large play, a sight
          for those who wished to wipe it when the nostrils relieved
          tears.

        <p>
           There was a house that had windows facing the open street
          in which we lived: the holy family of embroiderers. We were
          somewhat acquainted with a gang of stray alley Arabs, but
          they were unfit for moral speech--used to shout our names
          from a street off the main passing street, in that alley
          like a street. They sat on logs which were prepared for
          telegraph purposes. This often was mingled with the bravery
          of stealing apples from stands near grocery shops; it led
          to our dignity a hate and we soon reformed, omitting their
          acquaintance.

           Well, dear Daniel, it is unfortunate to write in bed. I
          can yet feel the music and the dingy room with music copies
          laden, where Clementi and Czerny were so sweetly chanted
          and practiced until late in the night; an oaken piano and
          many people shuffling here and there in warm cozy corners.
          As of Beethoven flame they sang and watched you perform.
          Candles and low divans and carpets gave a glow of life and
          cheer to such environment, which is as much out of habit
          nowadays as dictation.
        </p>
        <p>
           I have rested from writing at the end of "dictation." The
          plain fact is I like to steal a bit of personal instinct
          from some unusual feeling like talent or gift and terms of
          such meanings that may lead me to some deeper insight as to
          what justice the soul can demand; so in this retreat I see
          a sunset,
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          a bloody ruby glass of flat diamond mystery<br />
           underneath a fleece of fair purples,<br />
           and pale, placid yellow gold<br />
           clouded in the rounding of a horizon<br />
           of great fool-cast of illumination<br />
           resting unknown, cerulean,<br />

           After our ways and cares at that time when life grew to
          its height, a dispersal or a waver of happy opinion of the
          riches in the west brought to a conclusion a large amount
          of stuff that had to be sold--and nice things we lost and
          almost for nothing gave away.

           Daniel, that theater of toys was your masterpiece in
          life's youth. Adolf was appointed to lead the show, a real
          comedy; and the end was we were a bit confused as to the
          price of dealing and selling the pantomimic amusement.
          However, the notion was auctioned and the $50.00 was an
          addition to our fund for travel--fifty dull dollars.
        </p>
        <p>
           Well, we gathered our things as well as we could and sent
          our great man, the old soul of peace (God knows what purity
          he was then--and is now!), to the United States of America.
          Here I may be mistaken: Jacob Greenberg was capable of
          mastering his own independence. And he sailed before we did
          and took no money from the family. But we disposed of the
          house articles later and sailed with mother only; who is
          the heroine of life's care and great insight of love to me.

           It really is amusing to request information through
          advanced classic lore. Education seems never to give
          enough! So it is the plight of unrelieved wisdom and cure
          of character. I still can say that I wear an air for a
          tear, or a tear for a mirror, enjoy content and continue
          doing so.

           On the trip across the ocean there was little for me to
          see, for I was too ill to stir on my feet. I know that
          Daniel ate more fish and cabbage than any of us on the
          steamer--not a bad name for a ship--<cite>Lake
          Ontario</cite>. And so we departed--from the old world to
          the new.
        </p>
        <p>
           But still my eye sows back to the east of marvel and
          justice of natural honor; so it returns to my point of
          sentiment and fancy. Of the friends you had, some were
          artists, some were of excellent families, etc. However, we
          seem a bit doubtful as to my age to depict adventures
          abroad, again must admit premature occurrence.

           How about the landing on the shores of Columbia?

        <p>
           Well, it seems I must stop; my bed is being placed in open
          air for night's rest.

           From the miniature of writing thoughts that have and will
          give brighter resource to my mind and perhaps leave a
          stronger phase of pleasing attitude:--It was morning; a
          chill hung in an airy altitude, but soon after the hot and
          silent beverage I turned my gaze upon this regarded medium
          which perhaps <em>may show</em>. A good deal in this
          showing desire rests with me. Thus ends certain dislikes
          and graces which contained the source of expression in
          early childhood.
        </p>
        <p>
           The arrival of the ship <cite>Late Ontario</cite> was very
          careless. In its entering the port, the dinner below the
          deck seems to have been neglected. As we arrived, the mere
          serving of coffee or cocoa by a colored man was a bit late;
          and mother, who was of quick insight, noticed that we were
          disregarded--especially I, who stood on one end instead of
          the middle. Well, it was a peculiar moment. Both Morris and
          I had sailor suits of bright and cheerful aspect. At the
          tumult in landing shipments, we were all in the midst of
          drinking coffee and cocoa. Passing under the Brooklyn
          Bridge was almost fatal. Adolf, who slept near me on a
          large casing or wooden box, suddenly fell off. The reason
          was soon enough discovered: a father of vapors shared the
          river of light through its opening way . . . and perhaps
          many more were hurt upon the boat.
        </p>
        <p>
           We did not stay too long and were soon landed, examined,
          thoroughly questioned. Mother had her hair unloosed while I
          had my mouth examined, and so forth with the rest.

           Quality answers for quality. In my development through
          manners and unguided ways of youth I found slow progress in
          meeting the people who would lead me to the proper swing
          and crest that would bring the true harmony within and
          without: there is no complaint.
        </p>
        <p>
           Soon enough I was admitted into the public school by some
          difficult detailed event. Both father and mother anxiously
          endeavored to make rare conclusion of the excellence I
          showed in the European classes, with papers of the
          immigration and the health certificate shown to principal
          and teacher, who gladly appeared to accept foreign
          characters.

           By the fancy problems and abnormal cheer of the large
          display of classroom and polished desks, I soon was a
          contender to a chair of philosophy and science. Ah, I can
          clearly remember the letters of the alphabet written upon
          the blackboard and being told to make a copy of it to take
          home and rehearse. Here I soon became acquainted with girls
          as well as male companions, who were willing to assist me
          in school lessons at home, but it never occurred to me that
          they were anxious to follow friendship in secret service
          through fairyland development. My route to the academy of
          class 1A in the street of Suffolk, School 160, was soon a
          cozy environment. Early morning before the opening of the
          gates we obtained a delicious breakfast from a candy
          stand--a penny a cake, and a cup of cocoa adding two
          pennies . . . eh--good omens.

           In the handsome path of 1901 and 1907 I was a reaper of
          hard fact and geographical bliss; a whole world of purity
          and history was given to me to take home and examine at my
          interest. It was an unusual thanks-given material that
          served as an unconscious guide in my spiritual labors.
        </p>
        <p>
           There were many who wished that we stay away from school,
          for the very day of fairness itself was enough to educate a
          lizard. At certain times it was indeed very tempting, and I
          made an hour in the morning a king's absence from his
          throne. My step was really not dangerous; all I cared for
          was to indulge in the liberties of the national sports that
          the boys create between classes. Well, much to my
          disappointment I was always alone--alone.
        </p>
        <p>
           But as soon as I was told that school was over!--an
          unusual pride in the exercise of ball games took place in
          the mud of the gutter, where I was a constant menace to the
          shopkeeper and passer-by--and almost led to arrest, this
          wild stupid desire of play, at which I was a rank phantom
          of grace and easy applicant. Yet 'tis not a loss; the
          immortal assistance is still at large. The very game is an
          unusual sport, like wisdom, and seems to give me great
          truth when I lose myself from life.

           The transfer of scholarship was very sensitive to me. I

          because it was a new room.

        <p>
           Strangeness was becoming an awe of interest in watching
          women in pretty gowns with men on the streets. I sometimes
          would be influenced to fight another boy of my physique, or
          lured to show my exposing talents with a pair of leather
          workers ivory sticks and create a rhythm that negroes and
          Indians would highly demand.

           Well, I was not so old during the time of the Roosevelt
          election. My task was to sell posters:--"I told you so";
          also wickedly filed my way through Chinatown. I have not a
          clever memory to describe the little adventure. It is a
          fact that Japan and China were a mist of wild fear to me.
          The feeling of the earthly care became so dull, all that
          was the East Side history became a laurel of use to keep me
          from abnormal craze.

           I'm still in school. Christmas was a very beautiful
          observance of kindness. Visitors came from all parts of the
          city to give little gifts. The children were delighted to
          return their ways toward the teacher's care and make amends
          by buying silk kerchiefs in neat wrapped bouquets and
          ribboned parcels; and so bended a curious circle which
          became a tame class the following day.

           Once more my night has come to finish this informational

          will try to keep the pretty thoughts from escaping
          unnoticed, so that we shall decide in real life where the

           Happy in an absent state of mind I gave vent to copying
          Lincoln and Washington statues, which was soon noticed by
          the schoolmaster, who said I should go to drawing academy
          and gave me a name: Cooper Union. I never was anywhere from
          home to dome!

           I return to tell that conditions changed, and I was
          promoted to higher honors, which was in a street called
          Attorney near Rivington. There I kept learning arithmetic,
          spelling, reading, and the teacher was very anxious to have
          me draw Lincoln.

           Here I may say I still devour peaceful askance for

           There grew a curious zealous appetite for the Boy of '76:
          a hero who never fails in his attempts, nor finds his way
          safe in all battles, but still creates wonderful results
          with pure clean ladies kissing him for his earnest cheer.

           Many secrets and deep meditations as to how my money
          should be accumulated for books gave me a greed of retiring
          selfish impulse and amusement. There was an instant or a
          happening between business hours which was deeply
          offending--O this keeping life in daily appreciation of
          financial necessity, that kept me from my reading-- perhaps
          was a friend although felt keenly as an enemy! My father,
          who needed certain materials for working purposes in the
          line of embroidery, gave me a path into his secrets of
          buying fine bullion and silver thread. That alone was
          feignedly encouraging to drive me away from my novel
          interest, but I felt angry. So did father, and I had to go
          away to relieve kindness and reason.
        </p>
        <p>
           I soon was a victim to other insults because of these
          sloppy books and sloppy thoughts for which were no mortal
          judges of enjoyment and protected influence from natural
          dangers. I was often with Morris, a brother of luck and
          ambition, who took pleasure in the frantic chase for
          compositions toward classic melody and rhythm, chanted rare
          music which would keep me like a moth near a lamp to the
          piano he played. He never liked such books.

           The beauty of kindness in our household was at its height,
          even as a noble stirs in a castle of embellishments:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          Plush of red, plush of green<br />
           And spangle brilliancy glimmering here and there,<br />
           As the sea sand and a summer,<br />
           Shining silver light destroying love and thought,<br />
           But bringing sober lust into the hearts of dreamy temper.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
           We often found our father laboring over a frame of gold--a
          real act so easily remembered--some working maidens at his
          side; and perhaps even our mother took part in the
          exquisite handling of thread and stitch. Some pure Hebrew
          atmosphere gathered between our doors. Rabbi and priest,
          negro and Greek, such fathoms of character sprang up
          between the embroidery tasks. Such were the emblems of far
          and wide doings that have passed through our environment.
          There were some great things produced during the time on
          the East Side with the workings of gold and silver lining,
          which were given to churches of the finest temples.
        </p>
        <p>
           So, with an empty head full of no aim, I wandered here and
          there, from one window of toys to another, but nothing was
          so deeply set as the leisure crave, or perhaps unresisting
          helplessness that gave me an upward gaze to become
          independent.
        </p>
        <p>
           Yet school meant nothing to me, not even when I heard the
          piano at its wild, sonorous display.

           We had beautiful visitors, since the lessons which Daniel
          taught to pretty ladies became a languid familiarity and
          friendly concerts at home. This raised curiosity and a
          pleasant thrill that I might become a listener to the music
          they performed.
        </p>
        <p>
           Singing and dancing, weddings and masquerades,
          card-playing neighbors, landlords, holidays vanishing like
          food on a plate.

           It does me good to begin digging and adjusting past charms
          of action. The nights at home were in some respects
          comfortable. There were often discussions with artists,
          which brought Daniel into the painting habit. We closely
          watched him perform near a big canvas, which was being
          carefully prepared and often observed as a piece of
          talented labor. We thought the same way--bought canvas and
          brushes and began smearing, although I did not begin to
          care for fine arts until later. Morris, whose pearly
          fingers exhibited rare eyesight, gave me an example of
          artistic insight.
        </p>
        <p>
           Do you remember, O Daniel of name and nation, the concert
          you gave in a hall--a hall which educated the public of
          east New York in general discipline? The concert was a
          healthy one, but I carne near not seeing it performed. The
          day was a pleasant one and even street babies wanted to
          know if I was your brother: a stroke of precious flint here
          and now which gave me an absorbed countenance and perhaps
          leads to this memory of present script. The nocturnal eve
          was a dreary one when the hour of dress and bustle carried
          your first charm to the stage of this country. But even
          this honor fled!

        Life was now a spongy condition. Our mother gradually became
        ill: ear trouble, germ trouble, nose trouble, skull
        trouble--death trouble resulted and the family buried her
        somewhere on Long Island, where a cemetery called Washington
        was the grave for many poor victims, as our unpraised love
        was settled. We returned to a cafe near the doom place, where
        gathered a party of thirty or more, ate cheese and eggs with
        a schooner of beer and coffee. The rituals of the Jewish
        religion demand that one remain seated for seven days upon
        the floor. Well, we sat on soft cushions (the angels of
        wealth!). Thus ended a sorrowful, meaningless jubilee in an
        empty, beautiful world, with scarce a flower knowing joy. 
        <p>
           It grew lonesome and cold in the last place of the Suffolk
          Street apartment. A large one it was, I remember. All
          became numb and poor and soon the vast poverty settled and
          someone auctioned us out.

           In the street of Suffolk, corner of Grand, we lived for
          ten years. The poverty and insult of life cannot find
          sufficient words on paper; it was a struggle for decency
          for which we were usually gifted, but which soon drew to a
          conclusion. Fact seemed to be too earnest with our delicate
          household of nice parlor antiquities.
        </p>
        <p>
           We were a record-breaker to the moving man as the hour
          came which cannot be forgotten, the most dismal of
          happenings in my life--furniture and rats, filthy kitchen
          and ugly corner room that I occupied during the night.
        </p>
        <p>
           We got ready to depart, watching the bags of silver
          plates, gilded cups, rare pillows, mattresses. We woke in a
          dreary, cold web: sleeping-cave of rats and cabbage,
          sawdust floor--smelling sulphur fumes in an empty musical
          tomb.
        </p>
        <p>
           Father, who left the home to see our things made ready to
          leave, was deeply sorrowed over many ways and often
          mentioned our mother's name--what she would think of this
          predicament. However, we got past with a moving van.

           We must tip our hats to a Russian gentleman whom we called
          Ike Mass. Ike Mass was a mystic to me. I often felt his
          goodness to an extraordinary degree. All there was to do
          was to see the articles properly handled and safely removed
          into the new place of living. The street was Rutgers
          Square, and another religion prayed.

           In Rutgers Street was something regarding me. The mornings
          were as the mornings of school days--walking from Rutgers
          Street along a street called Division up to Chambers Square
          to a shop of leather workers or traveling bag makers; there
          I worked for over a year and a half.
        </p>
        <p>
           The picture of sadness and unyielding perseverance led to
          my doing things between times of labor. Often I would sit
          and draw from rare postcards, which were then obtained or
          bought at the Metropolitan Museum. Brother Morris did a
          great deal of thinking in the musical world and often
          through that freedom managed to see my attention upon the
          prints, which set on me an absorbed silence and assiduity.
          He also showed me how to get in it proper grace of
          delineation. It soon came to a decision that he would take
          me to a friend who practices and teaches pupils in painting
          old masters.
        </p>
        <p>
           The afternoon was sunny and warm, anxious weather. Morris
          and I were on an elevated train--but how my heart fluttered
          in pure fear of meeting classic masters of rare ability! We
          rang a bell on Park Avenue near 93rd Street: Frances
          Keller. But said Morris, "Mrs. Keller has a daughter you
          will go mad over. Such pure and brave character is seldom
          met in the world of painting."
        </p>
        <p>
           Soon enough I was admitted into an apartment of pictures
          which hung about the wall--copies of Corot and Titian, etc.

           A worker and a student laid bare the manner of
          introduction, where I took my lessons in paintings during
          evenings and practised the technique of brush and palette
          handling--also temperamental qualities and freedom of
          touch.
        </p>
        <p>
           But I began to understand wise pleasure's curation through
          the observing quantity from a natural secrecy. But it is
          all known; the truth is, you must sit and work out your own
          idea of feeling and grace of finish. It is not the
          discipline that decides artistic genius, for that is a
          thing in real existence, a fact of self-character. I
          thought well on my own stupid behalf. I soon gave it up,
          for I was too poor to assist in this abnormal creative
          formulation; there were other beautiful things to learn,
          even friendship and reading.
        </p>
        <p>
           "Concentration of study in the science of various
          inventions, astronomy, surgery, dentistry, floor sweeping;
          and stick to the habit of the quality that would shine for
          you until the end of your life." Thus spoke Diane, the
          teacher of art at the Park Avenue studio. "Keep up a heart
          for the marvel of expression and self-realization wherever
          you will stay. It will recuperate any bad memory to cheer."
          And it really seemed to be the fact, as we believed it to
          be in our self will of grace and nature. I often paid many
          personal visits to her, and found her to be a powerful
          miniature absorber to a religious conscience and to pay
          attention to instant care of aesthetic sentiment, relieving
          doubt.

           I'll whisper a prayer, for it is time to retire--not yet
          from the place of writing--only a little hint to tell me
          the last of my foreign culture and present satisfaction in
          pain and rest.
        </p>
        <p>
           My vocabulary has a great memory for foolish bliss, rather
          poor in careful selection and of grammatic assistance
          unguided. I did punish a philosophy of the Herbert Spencer
          style but then a feeling for poetic insight began to
          accumulate. I wrote anywhere, read merely to gain letters
          for the sake of rhyme, rewrote books, recited in a
          furnished room all alone, as fast as the life of an
          epicurean in a tower of scientific perseverance. Indeed no
          foolish path, but it was not public preparation. It was a
          self-gathering of natural prevention in the ways of life's
          action.
        </p>
        <p>
           However, many things of importance have passed my mind--
          composition as well as poetic attempts. My teacher was
          drawing my temper to a perfection of height to do. Many a
          time my strolls were between the room I had and Diane's
          studio. It soon was old in hours of love; everything became
          silent and familiar. I often met friends that knew my
          instructor, and we went together to see her to whom
          everybody was a spectacle of beauty and a model.
        </p>
        <p>
           One day in a greeting at the museum, Mrs. Keller, who
          copied there--who is still copying--told us that Madame
          Diane had died.

           After a sorrowful trail to find refuge in the art of
          music, I understood its proper detail and the power of
          practise; we cannot forget the visits to the Opera House of
          the Metropolitan. I know we liked it better than life!
          However, inspiration did not linger (it comes to whom it
          calls for), so I began writing plays, thinking to get to
          some rare operatic conclusion or real acquirement in the
          Bohemian circle of divine composition.
        </p>
        <p>
           The days were dreary and poor. Sickness closed in with its
          careful teeth, and I landed in the nearest insane bureau on
          an island for a year. Then things were calmer and my mind
          grew to be what it was, stupid and wanting to labor at the
          old shop of traveling bag making.
        </p>
        <p>
           And it happened again that the old story of weakness
          returned. I was taken to the hospital of descending
          charity, where things became a careful selection through
          sanitation and rest. Where was school? O what I would give
          for the knowledge of grammatic truth! But I saw that
          science is perfection as long as the world exists. I sat
          down and wrote a paragraph of sonnets under the title of
          "Apology" and a play called "Alma"; they were nonsense to
          real literature of careful justice. This little world of my
          own makes biography important to handle.
        </p>
        <p>
           So I continued with the spirit of fine arts, writing to
          friends once in a while, also feeling delighted to indulge
          silence.

           My last effort to reply: certain events which have
          occurred during the year of 1916 were satisfactory to me
          but not to those who missed me.
        </p>
        <p>
           Pianists and artists were now becoming too dull, and I sat
          down to find the very core of my boring opinion, finding a
          name for a play in which I can interpose my finest illusion
          of philosophy and presence of mind from my point of view
          only. It soon came to me to choose a fancy simplicity
          called "Capablanka"--well, not so deep as it is
          shallow--chosen in a melancholy stupor of fame and fortune
          and lofty peace and hope!
        </p>
        <p>
           My self-want became intuitive, a wild desire to understand
          the talent of natural taste. I soon found Daniel listening
          to me with faint interest, but dear for helping me to live;
          he has often visited me in my rare, lonely days, which
          thought became a vague rest to be any kind of contender in
          this world of joy and familiar manifestations.
        </p>
        <p>
           Art has mended my insane danger feelings, owing to the
          memory of writing things which is not common to thought in
          real life of action. I must say I possess the peace of love
          which robs me from pain and existence.
