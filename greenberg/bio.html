               href="rest.html#wards">Wards Island</a> in 1917, when
              he was only 23. His childhood was spent living in
              poverty on the Lower East Side of New York City.
              After leaving school at 14 to begin working to help
              support his family, he became ill, and spent his final
              years in and out of <a

              Staten Island, and Queens), where he did most of his
