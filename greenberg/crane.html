    <p>
       Critical attention to Greenberg has its foundation in studies
      of <a
       href="reading.html#crane">Hart Crane's</a> poetry. Crane's "<a
       href="emblems.html">Emblems of Conduct</a>", which his editors
      at first assumed to be a completely original work, is actually
      a mosaic of slightly-altered lines taken from six of
      Greenberg's poems. Crane never acknowledged Greenberg as the
      original author of the appropriated lines. The connection was
      not documented until both men were already dead.
    </p>
    <p>
       Most Crane scholars have maintained that Greenberg's effect on
      Crane's work may be seen only in "Emblems of Conduct" and in
      scattered lines in a few other poems. Within their analyses,
      however, there are sometimes suggestions that the influence may
      have been more extensive. John Unterecker, for example, in
      trying to downplay Greenberg's importance, ends up including
      him on a very selective list of influences:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <span
       class="c17">Greenberg's work entered Crane's mind in much the
      same way that Eliot's, Stevens's, Donne's, Whitman's and Poe's
      had.</span>*
    </blockquote>
    <p>
       <a
       href="reading.html#simon">Marc Simon</a> has since argued that
      Greenberg's effect on Crane was actually quite lasting and
      substantial. He cites the presence of Greenberg-like words and
      images in a number of poems, including "Voyages II", "The
      Tunnel", "Atlantis", "Lachrymae Christi", "The Dance", "Ave
      Maria", and "Cape Hatteras". Simon asserts that Crane
      eventually came to "symbolically identify" with Greenberg, and
      that this identification "aided [Crane] in the construction of
      his <cite>White Buildings</cite> and <cite>The Bridge</cite>."
