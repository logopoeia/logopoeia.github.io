         Long before surrealism became a movement, Greenberg was
        hypnotizing himself with words in orgies of supersensibility.
        He did not live long enough to exploit, or even to explore,
        the borderlands of the subconscious, but he seemed to dwell
        in a state between incoherence and eloquence, between sheer
        hallucination and pure vision.

         Although he published nothing in his lifetime, and has since
        been the victim of near-total critical neglect, Samuel
        Bernard Greenberg was the most original and most ravishing
        poet in the English language in the first decades of this
        century. . . . Out of the ragbag of his hermetic vagabondage,
        [he] drew one unheard-of extravagance after another. . . . He
        steered his own course as freely and implacably as Blake and
        Emily Dickinson and Lautréamont . . . <em>Here</em> is poetry
        defiantly alive with youth, exuberance, humor, revolt, and
        delirious love. . . . Never before had words and images
        enjoyed such exhilarating freedom as they did in the cheap
        grammar-school pencil tablets of this wayward invalid
        youngster.

         This poet, Greenberg, . . . was a Rimbaud in embryo. . . .
        No grammar, no spelling, and scarcely any form, but a quality
        that is unspeakably eerie and the most convincing gusto. One
        little poem is as good as any of the consciously conceived
        "Pierrots" of Laforgue.
