        By this effort one can be sure to missjudge the infinitum of
        penetration from a powerless vitality to ease the cripple of
        mortal dumbness of pleasure, by momentarily worship of

        - Before we breath a little further we will mention a
        character of mysterious in contention, all flowers of rare
        valor will, bend in their heaviness of grace, Can we pick
        such bloom to liken an ordinary youth of simple recandid
        beckonless attire? Why not? one little over memory will flash
        to distinguish, men who fought 'neath this silent space -
        paris quaters through latin enough?! The narrow streets of
        London's poor strikes ones manly precaution, and the
        wandering hero of passed predomination. - while being
        occupied in some necessary shoppings, I should mention this
        beastly damp wretched weather, which seems always an unusual
        case for the nieghbor to drop in, stopping at this building -
        yes, we can't look at it, but the inevitable eye tension
        never fails the spirits mood of appreciation. Behold! a three
        story half gloomy appearance, privately - overlooking
        structure, by a side glance one can tell that it also boards
        beneath the respectable and principle entrance, people of
        middle class and undertakers to live the housekeeping.

        Being that I am so very familiar with the vicinity that
        scarcely could one decieve his conscience from being
        personally encouraged to meet one you silently bewonder, soon
        my hands grasped a half repaired brass sommoner, all along
        the street their can be seen stray sparrows upon the ugly
        gutter with its hedious raiment of beaten rain, that tells a
        mirrors pussle of life in between, The sky seems to wonder in
        its half moaning gleam, Why such dwellings loom their frame
        beneath this abrupt protection, soon an interuption turned my
        gaze, The door was half way opened, "whom do you want?" was
        the response rather hasty and offspoken neglected foriegner,
        being a female servant, "Mr Veriker" - her voice loudly
        sounded indirectly again, "come in! come in! I will call
        him," here I boldly stepted in to think - "no no! don't tell
        him someone is here to see him," "but you can please show me
        where he rooms," she never answered and seemed happy to feel
        unburdened by ones self approval, in a quick retreat she
        dissappeared into the back stairway which leads to the
        basement below an apartment, Stopping to stoop for the
        banister, one never can tell how safe walking strange stair
        may lead to, gripping a hold the composition began wagging,
        as I drew near the top, all is quiet, yes voices of
        children's echo's sounded to my relief feeling my way safe,
        untill another round of steps half illumined, to guide one
        hight, seemed a bit indecent, comfortably leaning against the
        wall finally stood near the door, which was slightly ajar,
        hesitating to knock, a rap would anoy him, wondering a
        moment, I tipped the panel within the plank, not a sound from
        anywhere, reached my heave of gathered sentiment,

        now! this helped me inquire again, "Hello - who is there,"
        spoke a half absorbed voice - for a second their came a chill
        of mingled stuper through me, with the recolection of this
        soul within, briskly but unfirmly I griped a smooth parclin
        knob, lightly pushing it upen - "pardon me is this Mr ---"
        leaving the door partly apace, no second invitation was
        given, over a shabby quilt and loose underneath blanket in
        between half covered, Lieing against a high built up pillow a
        youth with a seanny wool wardrobe of faded vermilion,
        handsomely ruffled thick head of hair, undisturbed, guiding a
        large book of records of science and Aesthetics, after a

        The careless throw up of manuscripts and maps Beside the
        roomers bed, large fantastic drawing's of sketchy
        reflections, endowed the wall, which had an old cheap pink
        shaded aspect, would even throw the lightest speck into view
        - some odd frames of antique taste seem to prove his class
        effort to find faults with the works which was kept for
        remolding in his consideration, were held by the wall strewn
        here and there about the room, some were upon the floor, The
        wasted matting was worn by its familiar rubs from its
        frequent use of necessary paths in positions of most
        important, the corners of the room had traveling valises and
        some dusty canvases placed temporarily up against bowingly,
        near a window the onely upening there was except the door, -
        standing a shofenier, with a lyric shaped like glass, that
        seemed to complain in which her master abandons his spirit of
        motional attention, opposite the bed was a little parlor made
        table with books showing the value of them which he had
        chosen by many an auther, piled in groups sheets of music
        were also in between, and on top, of the volumes loosely
        thrown up, all fiegned a curious manner of handling and
        interfusion, beside this stand was a chair with a brown black
        tinged coat on its back, and trousers neatly placed on the
        seat, so that they should not badly lay to crease anoyingly,
        standing abruptly in its midst, still wondering why my friend
        pays less attention, who seeks entrance into his occupied
        corner, here I ventured to speak reproveingly - shall I be
        misstaken our greeting will not answer sufficiently in this
        odd manner of courtesy - but these discriptions will

        This happened in the regions of the slums of the "East side"
        -- New York -- deeply downtown, while bussing my way through
        the streets, closely escapeing my eye, someone hailed me
        rather weakly and inattionally, stopping to see who it may be
        why - "Mr. Veriket" - by the grace of Honor! calling me with
        his usual delicate mysterious sensetive wave by his arm, as
        if something very important must be availed, grasping me
        respectively by the hand and directs me towards a sHop, that
        would make -- Michleangelo whince, the most unusual place for
        such rarity is seldom met with, we may begin with stuffed
        birds and end in ancient, very aged moth eaten volumes of
        Holy scripture from the philogy of this creation, Enough! I
        just can easily penetrate his wonderful gift by his prophetic
        brilliancy and lofty love for litterature inexaustable, and
        never assuming a religious regard, and this worm Like
        inspiration would at times force me to say to him, "why do
        you choose to be so paralized in the abstract"? and his
        winning remark would thrill me when he would answer, what
        phrase is a hinderance!?" or How would you feel without the
        apprecian"!? after a short purchase of some wierd looking
        volumes and ornaments, we passed into the street walking
        lowly side by side into the nearest public park, where he as
        I could guess would sit and watch the children at play untill
        the hour of twilight directed him to return home.
