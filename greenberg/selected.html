        The blue faded purple Horizon mount<br />
         Seemed to bellow the vallies in mists<br />
         Of enriching ensueing divine shadowings<br />
         Where may this be? perhaps unpopulated<br />
         Crags of stepping rocks, where thought<br />
         Slumbers, inhaled thought, unbearing<br />
         Real earth, that refines, e'en the insects muse<br />
         Royality defies the haunt they chose<br />
         Therein mingles wild prespective charms<br />
         As immortelle's thorny entangled growth<br />
         Mongst the field of oaks pressing steep<br />
         Twilight's vail, Milky way's fence, the deep<br />

         Birds, wild swans, glide paly o'er a charming stream<br />

         ABnormal holy masses of unsettled dew<br />
         Proud to withhold an earth of lovly quality<br />

         When perfectly deceived of, its placid, unspoted<br />
         Surface, seems never to have been<br />
         Cleared, when facing its downward course<br />

	Holy discipline and wisdom's joy cannot shake the placid heart.<br />
	Disdain to climb, as tender as death - and time thus vanished,<br />
	Our angel's breath is felt - vision of our orbs through aimless rest.<br />
	The trembling heart has its limits divine, through light of man<br />
	Bares to fact and this heaven of grains, at last a sunshine<br />
	Sending its remains, silently doth ever toil, heaves an ocean,<br />
	As thy mind refuses to accept impression to satisfy;<br />
	In our fast travels and seeming blossom ne'er prove we by<br />
	Such mystic worth o'erhangs the might of powers disabled and shorn.<br />
	A voice exclaimed: "Love! wither wend we, O tiny children?"<br />
	This thrown door, eternally born, and germ home to be content with<br />
	May be a mark of century conduct, so brilliantly formed,<br />
	Lasts but within a poet's reach, in Nature's conquest left here,<br />
	Assuming danger and infinite silence through earthly fear - too pure<br />
	To feel asunder, sharing with starlike specks at night this uncertain force of wonder.
