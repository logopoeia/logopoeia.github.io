         and charted the felonious<br />
         phantomistic window shade<br />
         glasses, unmercifully, yuen<br />
         The seiving ariving was<br />
         merely making one feel<br />
         Limited from noise and<br />
         curiousity, here my wing<br />
         cannot stay so short so I<br />
         leave, no sleep - no comfort<br />
         From the self - still amiable<br />
         The might again prowls to my<br />
         HearT, - O tomb of lovely pitch<br />
         Immensity - do you love<br />
         this last open eye or do you<br />
         think we can Be well as<br />
         you place yourself - you<br />
         can een hear the perch of<br />
         The dutch stork in fowl land<br />
         You tell me of the miser's<br />
         ocean mint, the city as in<br />
         Dreamingland lost from<br />
         explaination, and yet keep<br />
         soothing me that many more<br />
         are selfishly defettered, --<br />
         wo! you sweep you shave the<br />
         Bony nerves e'en the plenty meat<br />

         The tusks of Blood
      </h2>
      <div
       class="stanza">
        Therin I begin, what avail?<br />
         My chant must enclose hell<br />
         And yet here leave behind<br />
         Myself of touch and vow<br />
         My hour has come when<br />
         The Brief song of the Greek gails<br />
         Have found the inner teeth alone<br />
         Here listen, someone is calling<br />
         Why the ugly praise and fate<br />
         Shall I be a joiner to this<br />
         And leave Here the good hope<br />
         Not to prank the lucky star<br />
         I'll apologize, wait untill<br />
         The great way works for Woe!<br />
         Woe - never you parsival boob<br />
         never, and by the trait of love's<br />
         Light shell, sheering outpour<br />
         Not to Blame, - wait, a travel<br />
         For an exuse, a good life lay<br />
         and the real actions, the pomped<br />
         Horn, - and the pardons of a<br />
         door - Hell the word what<br />
         interfereing clashed love rules<br />
         My thoughts mix in Brownings<br />
         Pool IceHearsels, not to phasing<br />
         of rearing love on wings - send<br />
         here another wonder pestive 'plore<br />
         shall I write o anger hast thou<br />
         Not treated thy refuging forbare<br />
         The prink orb honey - the brattle!<br />
         not to leave o poet aye form!<br />
         thy mongolien fringe of foul perfume<br />
         The falling off - weep for a keep<br />
         that o shade salons its pierce<br />
         Perhaps I can walk a bit<br />
         To my truthful vein and relate<br />
         The sport of the steeds that trot<br />
         The stiring mucsles of an earthly<br />
         gait, and my hearted glow<br />
         O worm - worm-heated soil<br />
         peal sad mereing folds<br />
         There cometh a home afar<br />
         and again a slow fainting glow<br />
         glideing over a path, - easily seen<br />
         god - some voice disturbs me<br />
         from the inner room - and<br />
         Believe - a she and aged she<br />
         Yet Telling her moments forbide<br />
         In a soft voice, trifle heavy<br />
         another aged crankling noise<br />
         sitting her defence of knowledge<br />
         poh! knowledge, - the last of god<br />
         O no I mean my own surprise<br />
         spoke the first - here left<br />
         in her virtues returns andad<br />
         I catch the subject - Death!<br />
         - Death, what a careless value<br />
         to such aged spirits, again<br />
         a sad remark, - Life not valued<br />
         By such retired souls, who<br />
         should Be apart to Believe<br />
         justice, - uh man not thy boast<br />
         who shall reform eer divein<br />
         Proof, e'er we save sal brun<br />
         He was a marked lad<br />
         Who poorly helped himself<br />
         What should this mean<br />
         Fill your pockets - I'll let<br />
         You know the grass of a grave<br />
         no punch, the care was society<br />
         O pillars of silk and good tea<br />
         Confusion of women, the Bare bust<br />
         ambarrassment, - carnal filth<br />
         of its justice, lacks invironment<br />
         O creaking earth, necessity, hell<br />
         No more wise then the next child<br />
         of Herald, what can he give?<br />
         What can he give?<br />
         Yon pallid stork - gazing -<br />
         who gazed before you cooled<br />
         the summer spray for the shoulder<br />
         Very bad for an apt jew to claim<br />
         everlasting renaissance, what<br />
         a delivery was this from good<br />
         conduct and prizeing anthology<br />
         Sucked By secret gilded creatures<br />
         who slew gold for a memBranes<br />
         iontumination, dilapidation<br />
         Blott erst in vampiration<br />
         O tears sped into the basin<br />
         of a louvre groose design<br />
         Potting the grissley ullalumie<br />
         Of sparkling night aghast in silence<br />
         repairing the sidewalk<br />
         and steel frames avast<br />
         The pillar brick Block<br />
         And the pipes swift pain<br />
         Of the boiling steam shocks<br />
         Uplifting - high - decent<br />
         Yon - endless wretch of silver<br />
         and clouded fogs of news<br />
         Ah no blesses misgiveing<br />
         For all returns, my story<br />
         will But insist you away<br />
         from your self, and before it<br />
         is over, a saying - quick, a<br />
         teacher - a teacher, where is<br />
         he - where lord a teacher<br />
         preacher, unBleacher, come<br />
         quick, we searched, O<br />
         forgive - your wisdom I forgot,<br />

        O gaze untold Dear Kopeiran<br />
         &#160;&#160;I Barely could utter fiegn<br />
         By the trace of Beauty O Kopeiran<br />
         &#160;&#160;I drank By the shores of the main<br />
        <br />
         again wickedly I sought<br />
         From whence can I reBuke<br />
         such pain that soiled the sheal<br />
         that veered the locus of pregnance<br />
         and sent him alone to yeald<br />
        <br />
         I wandered alone to the desert<br />
         &#160;&#160;and found the fever dry<br />
         But the flower that swept By Bliss<br />
         Is still Blown and unsought at thee nigh<br />
        <br />
         But amid slumber I sealed aweep<br />
         &#160;&#160;as I crept for a phantom thought<br />
         That could seal e'en Heavens leaking<br />
         From more earths and stars that are wrought<br />
        <br />
         O Line of truce<br />
         Can'st thou Hasten to regaze<br />
         As the angle that marketh the seed<br />
         And feeds its lowly phase<br />
