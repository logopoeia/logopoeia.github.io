      Despite his millions, Luciano Pavarotti sang almost as well as
      Di Stefano, especially Puccini, especially the "Nessun Dorma"
      aria from <cite>Turandot</cite> that had unexpectedly (and
      absurdly) shot to the Top of the Pops as the theme music to
      some silly televised football championship or other, a few
      years back; never mind, thought Father Doyle, better for the
      hoi polloi to get their culture through the locker-room door,
      as it were, than not at all. Anyway, Di Stefano was still the
      best: that voice, as strong and supple as a man's innermost
      longings--or was it only because he'd actually seen Di Stefano
      once, at the Teatro Santa Cecilia, swapping arias with Maria
      Callas, that he felt so righteous about it? <a
       id="fnB0"
       name="fnB0"
       href="#fn0">[1]</a> Odd, by the way, how the Roman audience
      had shown their affection in the rudest ways imaginable to a
      Northerner accustomed to devoutly hushed concertgoers (the
      Protestant influence, no doubt): paper bags crackling,
      catcalls, even a chorus of hisses when the two stars embarked
      on the Love-death duet from <cite>Tristan and Isolde.</cite>
      Tancredo had joined in the ructions <em>con gusto,</em>
      priest's collar and all, somewhat unsettling his <em>amico
      irlandese,</em> but as he'd explained afterwards, flushing
      bright red over a Galliano or so at their favorite <em>
      bar-gelateria</em> near the Stazione Termini, that particular
      music was simply too German, so soon after the war ('47-'48, or
      thereabouts): too damned Wagnerian, in short, with the usual,
      not yet banal, connotations of stiff-arm salutes, Triumph of
      the Will, mass murder and so on. No Christian forgiveness for
      that lot, at least not until the war generation died out, said
      young Padre Tancredo, neck muscles flexing in his <em>passione
      anti-tedescha!</em> How the lad hated the Jerries, back then.
      He probably still did, unless all those years in Paris had
      smoothed the edges. The French were a compromising lot, weren't
      they, by and large, less given to sustained anger than the
      Italians (not that he knew many himself, but still) . . . in
      any case, such passion for things secular was something Father
      Doyle could never share, with his growing contempt for the
      everyday world as a stage for mediocrity and ignorance and
      venality of every sort, not excluding his own--for instance,
      the bottle he kept hidden in his desk along with the packet of
      Craven "A" (good name, that), both of them now softly
      illuminated in the smoke-veiled light of the
      desklamp--starting, in fact, with his own weaknesses, and
      building on that flimsy foundation to include hypocrites,
      meddlers and busybodies from every walk of (ah yes) life; <em>
      life?</em> For most people, it was little more than the absence
      of death, to all appearances a mere repetition of comings and
      goings, enlivened by television. As much as he loved life's
      more bearable aspects, Father Doyle detested its overall
      cheapening, and television was the worst cheapener, after overt
      atheism, politicking, money-grubbing, and the like; it was the
      very soul of popular culture (or should that be <em>soil</em>,
      as in night-?) and few things aroused in him a keener sentiment
      of disgust and betrayal. Popular culture, indeed! What a sham.
      When he read the newspapers, or (inadvertently, or when they
      were showing a BBC costume drama) watched the idiot box, or
      listened to the radio (except for RTE3's operas and symphonies,
      with a dash of Irish traditional), he felt naked and alone in a
      glaring arena of clamor and harshness and--worst of
      all--<em>fashion,</em> all of them enemies of spirituality and
      art and the Eternal: Satan's work, to be quaint about it, being
      carried out quite well, thank you very much, by unthinking
      minions, unbenownst to themselves--sure, they'd never catch on,
      they'd deny they were doing anything worse than providing for
      their families, or helping the national economy, or ensuring a
      comfortable retirement in the Balearics, or Torquay, (or
      Killoyle); but Father Doyle was well-trained, his still-sharp
      eye saw through the counterfeit everydayness, the calculated
      banality, the so-called Real World that lulled hapless Mr. and
      Mrs. Everyman into their semi-detached dream with all mod cons
      (two cars in the garage, cable TV, microwave)! <em>He</em> knew
      that underneath all that was the same old come-hither, more
      modern than the flamboyant horned and tailed galloping about of
      yore, of course, you couldn't accuse Old Nick of not being
      up-to-date, no, he'd studied us well, he'd learnt to ape our
      mannerisms, he'd metamorphosed into a myriad scientists and
      television personalities and pop stars and journalists, and
      now--<em>voilà!</em> It was all going his way, <em>viz.</em>
      straight to Hell: churches emptying, crime on the rise, Hindu
      and Eskimo and animist and God only knew what other gods
      banishing the One True (the return of the pagans: Pan's
      revenge), sex turned into the reductio ad absurdum of all human
      desire, modern education become the funeral pyre of our hopes,
      beauty unknown, ugliness revered, everyone (in short) rushing
      pell-mell towards that spiritual wasteland from which they'd
      emerge only as reborn servants of the Fallen One!
    </div>
    <br />
     

    <div>
      Or so it seemed to Father Phil, in pensive mood.
    </div>
    <br />
     

    <div>
      He paused in his ruminations to add his voice to Pavarotti's in
      the next selection.
    </div>
    <br />
     

    <div>
      "Not now, Father," pleaded Mrs. Delaney, his housekeeper, from
      the next room. Loud thumps emphasized her point, but he
      defiantly soared to more ambitious, near-falsetto heights:
    </div>
    <br />
     

    <div>
      "OOO-na fooorteeeevaah LAH-cream-AHHH."
    </div>
    <br />
     

    <div>
      A cough loitered with intent. He stopped singing and, instead,
      emitted via the opposing orifice a sound similar to that a
      rubber duck might make, if trodden on heavily.
    </div>
    <br />
     

    <div>
      "Take that, Mrs. Delaney," he muttered.
    </div>
    <br />
     

    <div>
      How pathetic to be intimidated by one's housekeeper, for God's
      sake! Worse than being a henpecked husband, <a
       id="fnB1"
       name="fnB1"
       href="#fn1">[2]</a> because there were none of the presumed
      compensations--presumed, mind you, but by no means guaranteed,
      from what he'd heard. Hadn't his own big brother Ronnie hauled
      his missus (a slip of a girl but stronger than she looked) up
      before the bench, accusing her of denying him his conjugal
      rights for six months at a stretch? And her excuse, poised on
      the cusp of a sob, had been that whenever Ronnie
      wanted--<em>that,</em> it was Saturday night and he'd a drop
      taken and was in no way fit to father more children, not on top
      of the five they already had, and she'd not be a party to
      bringing infant drunkards into this vale of tears, doing her
      level best to bribe the judge with tears of her own but failing
      to charm the jury, ten hard men and two harder women who
      returned a verdict of Guilty As Charged and got her to swear
      conjugal loyalty--in other words, spread 'em, girl! It was an
      injunction she'd evidently obeyed without delay, the outcome
      being Father Phil's new nephew Festus, born the exact length of
      one gestation period thereafter and raising the brood's grand
      total to six, with another said to be on the way; and during
      the week or so that followed the trial, wouldn't you have
      thought Ron was the King of the Great Blasket island itself,
      what with his brays of triumph and hipwise swagger in all the
      pubs of the town? <a
       id="fnB2"
       name="fnB2"
       href="#fn2">[3]</a>
    </div>
    <br />
     

    <div>
      "God, what an arsehole," muttered the priest, through an
      exhaled thunderhead of cigarette smoke. He'd never much cared
      for his big brother, if the truth were known. Apple of mumsy's
      eye--bah! Their old man wasn't fooled, at least. He'd seen
      through his first-born from the day he caught him behind the
      privet hedges at Brookeborough raceway, peppering horses'
      backsides with an airgun, the way he'd make the odd fiver from
      punters not too proud to give others' odds an extra handicap.
      Of course, Ronnie got his own backside nicely tanned after that
      episode, but devil the lesson it taught him; no, if Experience
      ever spoke to a thickhead like Ronnie Doyle, it was in muted
      tones--sotto voce--or not at all, as with (to be honest) so
      many others as well, when you thought about it, as Father Phil
      did, with unnerving frequency, not being in his opinion the
      aptest student of experience himself. The sum total of what
      he'd learned in his sixty-eight years (apart from the truth of
      the old Greek's remark that all he knew was that he knew
      nothing) was to believe in Belief against all evidence to the
      contrary, thereby making the best of a bad bargain and shoring
      up the defenses against Satanic doubt, or belief in the
      unbelievers: <em>Lord, help thou my unbelief!</em> If only it
      were easier in the normal course of things, on a clear head, in
      ordinary streets, on an ordinary day, amid ordinary bustle.
      Some couldn't take it, Freddie Stripling for one, yelled at by
      unseen voices until he up and headed for the five-floor drop,
      restrained at the last moment by (who else?) his housekeeper. A
      sad case, but the Monsignor was an austere and anguished man.
      He'd have done better to unwind now and then, put his feet up,
      have a cigar, watch television--<em>aha! how subtly doth he
      weave his web!</em>

    <div>
      Father Doyle's own nightly drinking and secret smoking (not so
      secret in the stale air of mornings after) were, he realized,
      symptoms of the same balancing act, as were his lapses, public
      and private. The dear knew he wasn't as young as he'd once
      been, but forgetting the better part of the sermon when he'd
      already delivered it twice--God Almighty, what would he do
      next? Wet himself during confession? He'd done it once, not
      recognizing the sensation at first - taking it, in fact, to be
      either (a) gas, or (b) his hernia uncoiling itself (then the
      stain, the whiff, the shame) . . . and what else? Drop the next
      line of the Our Father? Not impossible: he'd learned his
      Paternoster in its grand and glorious mother tongue, after all,
      not vulgar <em>Sachsùn</em> <a
       id="fnB3"
       name="fnB3"
       href="#fn3">[4]</a><em>.</em> Grope members of the
      congregation? Unlikely. This particular servant of Christ took
      his vows about as far as most priests did (or had ever done,
      piety being a relatively recent innovation in the Church, what
      with the Medicis and monastic orgies and popes like Leo X,
      Henry Ford of the relic trade, who said, back in 1500 or so,
      "This myth of Christ has served us well", while cackling over
      the year's balance sheet: plenary indulgences in one column,
      relics in another) . . . and yet! What was the point in
      abstaining from Sin when the very notion was under siege?
      Abortion rampant, the Sacred debased--everywhere, really, <a
       id="fnB4"
       name="fnB4"
       href="#fn4">[5]</a> but like most trends it got started across
      the Atlantic, where priests wrote bestselling pulp fiction and
      went about with one hand in their trousers and the other in the
      till . . . not that Ireland was free of such things, of course,
      with the nation's center of gravity shifting to the Cardinal's
      residence in Armagh every time there was a referendum, or a
      general election; so, as viable sins permissible to the muddled
      but rigorous priest that he was, that left whiskey and tobacco,
      tried and true friends of the friendless, boon companions of
      bachelor nights, mainstay of many a publican's fortune and
      soldier's Dutch courage, innocent failings for the most part,
      winked at by God and Man alike--sure, wasn't it the oldest of
      Celtic customs, going back at least to wild-haired Brehon days,
      to overlook a good man's only weakness, that good man more
      often than not being a priest, or bard, or mumbler of
      mumbo-jumbo written or spoken, drunk or sober? In the words of
      Father Phil's own mother, invariably repeated on Saturdays and
      market days: "Yer dad's a fine and daycent man the way he is,
      and only for the drink he'd be a friggin' saint." <a
       id="fnB5"
       name="fnB5"
       href="#fn5">[6]</a> Could the same be said of the son?
      Sentenced by his calling to die childless, a disused locomotive
      parked on an overgrown siding, <em>off the main line of Life. .
      . ?</em> This image gave him pause. He reached for the bottle,
      poured, sipped; reaching then for the metaphor, he held it out
      at arm's length, turned it over, and examined it from all sides
      before recognizing it as one among many items left over from
      his salad days, the baggage wagon of Youth hitched to
      yesterday's Belfast-Dublin express, via Lisburn, Dundalk, and
      Drogheda . . . that metaphorical siding's original, if memory
      served, <a
       id="fnB6"
       name="fnB6"
       href="#fn6">[7]</a> was somewhere outside Drogheda, and on the
      other side was a brick wall, beyond which the chimneytops of a
      mansion, also brick, protruded above the tree tops like
      donkeys' ears. At the end of the siding was a faded sign that
      read Dillrea Manor Halt--redundantly, as nothing on rails had
      halted at Dillrea Manor since the days of gaslight and hansom
      cabs. It was a fine place for a young man's mind to people with
      ghosts, and a logical place to translate into a metaphor for
      life's less-than-happy endings, in much the same way as the
      statue of Henry Grattan on College Green--and, by extension,
      the all-encompassing history of central Dublin, from the Viking
      era (the Quays) to the Ascendancy (Grattan, his Parliament),
      via the Elizabethan age (the gates of Trinity, Trinity
      itself)--appeared in his mind whenever the subject of History,
      Irish or otherwise, arose in words or memory, although the
      (admittedly infrequent) mention of H. Grattan. Esq., per se
      tended, illogically, to evoke a pristine mental picture of the
      market square in Omagh, Co. Tyrone, home town not of Grattan
      but of Benedict Kiely the once-poor scholar; and on those rare
      occasions when Ben Kiely was thought, or spoken, of, with a
      supreme sense of comedy (Ben being quite a Nationalist) Father
      Doyle's psycho-cinema ran a jiggling old reel of Union
      Jack-festooned ferryboats setting out from Dun Laoghaire in the
      days when it was called Kingstown and the Union Jack flew from
      every flagpole in Ireland, North and South! <a
       id="fnB7"
       name="fnB7"
       href="#fn7">[8]</a>
    </div>
    <br />
     

    <div>
      But when he thought of Youth, he thought of Rome.
    </div>
    <br />
     

    <div>
      Coincidentally, as Father Doyle's thoughts roamed to that city,
      so did Pavarotti's, with the result that both of them, ignoring
      Mrs. Delaney, offered up "Arrividerci Roma" to the spirit of
      the Trevi Fountain, one of the few paganisms Father Doyle had
      ever permitted himself. How many pennies had he thrown in that
      fountain? More than a pound's worth, surely, over that year of
      nocturnal wanderings by the antic moon and daily walks in the
      imperial sun; yet--even with all that investment--he'd never
      returned, except, as now, in his dreams. It was ridiculous,
      absurd, unforgivable! Canada he'd seen, and America, and
      wretched New Nubia; Venezuela, and Surinam, and Brazil, too; of
      Europe's Catholic heart, he knew Alsace, the Rhineland and
      Bavaria; Poland even, and the Valais, and the Limburg province
      of Holland; Belgium, as well, and Iberian provinces beyond the
      counting of them; but after a lifetime's roving hither and yon,
      not once in the intervening forty-odd years had he managed to
      extend his Italian wanderings below (say) Rimini, or Siena!
    </div>
    <br />
     

    <div>
      Still, if there was anything to that old fairy tale, he'd make
      it yet.
    </div>
    <br />
     

    <div>
      Pavarotti fell silent. To fill the void, Father Doyle sang the
      first words of "Three Coins In A Fountain", dressing his
      imaginary self in summer whites beneath a broad-brimmed hat
      (Pope Phillip I?) to stroll the sweet-breezed expanse of Piazza
      del Popolo in the light of a Raphael sky . . . .
    </div>
    <br />
     

    <div>
      "Three coy-ins in a fowan-tain," he brayed. Suddenly he
      cringed, partly at the concomitant thought of Italo-American
      crooners and their horribly bejeweled hangers-on, <a
       id="fnB8"
       name="fnB8"
       href="#fn8">[9]</a> and partly (indeed, mostly) because a
      brand-new pain chose that moment to put on a short but
      memorable demonstration. It skipped nimbly from his right
      shoulderblade to the approximate area of his liver, or greater
      pancreas region, en route lassoing his diaphragm with barbed
      wire and poking a red-hot finger into his chest, achieving its
      full effect when the lasso tightened momentarily and the fiery
      finger probed deep enough to bring out sweat on his brow. After
      a few seconds that stretched into micro-eternities, the pain
      slackened and vanished, abruptly and completely, except for a
      twinkling of residual painlets up and down his right arm - his
      <em>right</em> arm, mind you, so it wasn't. . . .
    </div>
    <br />
     

    <div>
      Father Doyle put down his drink with a hand that trembled ever
      so slightly.
    </div>
    <br />
     

    <div>
      "Baldy ballocks," he gasped.
    </div>
    <br />
     

    <div>
      Later, in bed, he spoke familiar words of comfort, to himself
      and another, hailing She who was full of grace. There was a
      church, he remembered, on the Via Bonifacio, near the Gesù,
      where beggars gathered, one of many shrines to the
      Virgin--Santa Maria del Cielo? Della Grazia? Santa Maria de
      something. The priest there--Bob Whalen, as he remembered, from
      the Irish College--was a good soul, utterly devoted to Mother
      Mary in an old-fashioned, pre-Vatican II way; in fact, he
      claimed she'd cured him of the malaria he'd contracted on
      mission in Central Africa, as well as of a number of lesser
      ailments: sinusitis, asthma, bronchitis--although that could
      just as easily have been the Roman climate by contrast to his
      native Donegal's (or was it Sligo?). He'd be in his late
      seventies or early eighties if he were still alive (<em>tempus
      fugit, irreparabile tempus!),</em> yet it was easy to believe
      he might be, with his unquestioning faith in the Holy Mother
      and the happiness she'd given him. Surely that was all the cure
      a man needed! Thinking of Bob Whalen at that moment for the
      first time in years, Father Doyle felt envy entering his soul,
      also for the first time in years, and he resolved to purge it
      by looking up Santa Maria de Whatsit and its pastor without
      delay, on his very first day back in Rome. <a

      <a
       id="fn0"
       name="fn0"
       href="#fnB0">[1]</a> Indubitably. I mean, better than
      Pavarotti's just not on. For a start, I've never heard of this
      Di Stefano, and what's more, in my opinion a gal singing a
      fella's roles is the next thing to flaming transvestism and I
      don't care who knows it. Call me old-fashioned, but there it
      is. Anyway, once you've heard Pav in <cite>Cav</cite> and
      <cite>Pag</cite> (try the IMI cassette/CD recording: Pav and
      Joanie and the Hyde Park Philharmonic under Sir Charles
      Coelecanth --or was it Colin?) you can pretty well tear up your
      lease and hand over the keys, if you know what I mean. <a

    <div>
      <a
       id="fn1"
       name="fn1"
       href="#fnB1">[2]</a> Than which there is nothing worse, unless
      you're a cockpecked wife. <a
       href="#fnB1">[back]</a>
    </div>
    <br />
     

    <div>
      <a
       id="fn2"
       name="fn2"
       href="#fnB2">[3]</a> It's like the da always said: a man's
      intellect should be measured in inverse proportion to how
      loudly he speaks--and never trust a fella that talks at a
      higher pitch than the noon whistle at the Guinness brewery! Do
      you know, the wisdom of that man beggars description, so it
      does. <a
       href="#fnB2">[back]</a>

    <div>
      <a
       id="fn3"
       name="fn3"
       href="#fnB3">[4]</a> Ir.: Saxon. <a

    <div>
      <a
       id="fn4"
       name="fn4"
       href="#fnB4">[5]</a> Everywhere, is it? Speak for yourself.
      I've been going to Confession on and off since 1934 (mostly
      off, since '68), and if I've learned one thing in my life, it's
      that the Irish church is a hard man altogether. <a
       href="#fnB4">[back]</a>
    </div>
    <br />
     

    <div>
      <a
       id="fn5"
       name="fn5"
       href="#fnB5">[6]</a> Isn't that just like dads and uncles?
      Take my uncle Francis,for one: rumor had it he was in with the
      Opus Dei crowd. Well, maybe he was and maybe he wasn't, but he
      did always favour black shirts and pullovers, and one night I
      caught him saluting himself in the mirror, wearing nothing but
      black footer bags! Anyhow, after the video scandal, he led a
      retiring life, mostly in the olive groves around Seville,
      preaching to the shepherds and fashioning combs and toothpicks
      from fallen tree branches. They fetch quite a handsome price,
      now that he's been beatified. <a
       href="#fnB5">[back]</a>

    <div>
      <a
       id="fn6"
       name="fn6"
       href="#fnB6">[7]</a> Your past is served, sir, as the da used
      to say whenever bill collectors came calling. Once he said it
      to Des Neeson the bailiff, who didn't take it at all well and
      stood on the doorstep mumbling threats until it was too dark to
      see; <em>then</em> he slapped him with an eviction notice!
      Needless to say, Da slapped him back, but to no avail. <a
       href="#fnB6">[back]</a>

    <div>
      <a
       id="fn7"
       name="fn7"
       href="#fnB7">[8]</a> Up the Republic, as my Uncle Mike always
      said, Sunday mornings when I was applying the wet towels. <a
       href="#fnB7">[back]</a>
    </div>
    <br />
     

    <div>
      <a
       id="fn8"
       name="fn8"
       href="#fnB8">[9]</a> I know what he means. Once we went to Las
      Vegas, and the jewellery! I could hardly see my hand in front
      of my face, the glare was so intense. The doctor told me later
      that my symptoms were identical to snow blindness, and
      prescribed tinted contacts, or a corneoplasty to inflate the
      eyeball. <a

       href="#fnB9">[10]</a> Rome the spiritual or Rome the temporal?
      Aye, it matters (see below). <a
