     class="c3">Prologue</h3>

      <p><i>Last night, I dreamt I went to Spudorgan again. It
      seemed to me I stood by the roundabout leading to the
      MacLiammoir Bypass, and I wanted desperately to get across;
      for a while I could not pass, for the way was barred to me by
      the press of traffic, mostly spanking-new Jocelyn GTs, with
      the odd Jag here and there. Then, like all dreamers, I was
      possessed of a sudden by supernatural powers and passed like
      a spirit through the cars before me. Uphill Street wound away
      in front of me, twisting and turning as it had always done.
      But as I advanced, I was aware that a change&mdash;nay,
      changes!&mdash;had come upon the fair city by the sea, my
      Killoyle of dreams. Mammon had come into his own again, and
      little by little had encroached upon the city with long
      tenacious fingers, entarting this tavern, expanding that
      carpark, englamouring that once-barren coffeehouse. And
      finally, there was Spudorgan Hall, once desolate, once known
      and unloved as The Rat Palace, now a festive and plush member
      of Vacation Inns Worldwide. And nor Time nor Mammon could mar
      the perfect symmetry of those walls. . .</i></p>

      <p class="attrblock">&mdash;from <i>A Poet Does His Nut</i>, <i>Vol.
      I:</i>&nbsp;Years of Struggle</i>, an unpublished bildungsmemoir by
      Milo Rogers, Poet Laureate of Munster</p>
    <br />

    <h3
     class="c3">Chapter 1</h3>
      <p>Miming the petulant <i>moue</i> of, say, a Roman
      sensualist of the post-Antonine era, or a Regency brat under
      the Younger Pitt, Michael T. &ldquo;Mick&rdquo;
      McCreek&rsquo;s face, that interesting preface to the rather
      ordinary rest of him, buried itself pillowdeep in a vain
      attempt to avoid the probing rays of the rising Irish sun, a
      weak sun at best but a game one, bedad, and not a sun to be
      shut out of the bedroom window of Flat 16A, Padre Pio Houses,
      by a mere flimsy curtain or so. Indeed, by shining
      persistently and directly onto your man&rsquo;s
      Romano-Regency face, it illumined in an unwelcome, glaring
      red glow the intricate Mississippi-delta network of his
      inner-eyelid veins.<a id="_ftnref1" href="#_ftn1"
      name="_ftnref1"
      title=""><![if !supportFootnotes]>[1]<![endif]></a> He
      grumbled. Slowly, sleep ebbed as sufficient time dragged
      itself along, with the lame determination of a hunchback<a
      id="_ftnref2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"
      title=""><![if !supportFootnotes]>[2]<![endif]></a> in heat,
      to accommodate the twin phenomena, one tactile, the other
      aural, of 1) warmer sunshine splashing onto Mick&rsquo;s gob
      and 2) a car outside starting up with hiccupping roars
      exacerbated by much boot-to-the-floor pedal-pumping followed
      by the gear-grinding diminuendo of exceedingly slow
      departure.</p>

      <p><i>There goes that Indian dickhead</i> (shouted the
      uninvited thought-announcer in Mick&rsquo;s brain) <i>at the
      wheel of his effing old Escort that he should have sent to
      the junkyard long since, the stingy wee bastard, turning his
      lights off in the middle of the night and spewing clouds of
      burnt oil left right and centre and no bloody notion in the
      world of how to shift into first...!</i></p>

      <p>With all this external din and internal mind-palaver Mick
      was distracted, uneasy, a failed sleeper; in fact dangerously
      near wakefulness and getting closer all the time, what with
      one thing and another&mdash;his Indian neighbour&rsquo;s
      departure, the sun scorching his face, the new day&rsquo;s
      being Monday. It was a full sixty-second minute or more
      before the perfect (indeed only) solution wormed its way into
      his awakening brain: <i>Turn over, son!</i></p>

      <p>He obeyed, and was at once conscious of a coolness of
      visage counterbalanced by a rapidly-warming spot on the nape
      of his neck where Old Sol, still staring through the
      halfhearted window-curtain, now focused his gaze. Of course,
      it <i>was</i> the morning, and Mick <i>did</i> have a job,
      however ludicrous (very: assistant test driver for Jocelyn
      Motors)<a id="_ftnref3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"
      title=""><![if !supportFootnotes]>[3]<![endif]></a>; give him
      credit, though, he was a realist, by and large, and that
      morning he was, consequently, soon out of bed and well
      downstairs, in fact in the immaculately white kitchen itself,
      blearily scrutinizing the controls of his birthday
      coffee-maker, last year&rsquo;s (and no doubt last, as in
      lifelong) gift from Eileen, his ex, on the occasion of his
      fortieth.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Nice of her,&rdquo; he mumbled. &ldquo;But how
      typical, for God&rsquo;s sake, to give me something I
      don&rsquo;t know how to use.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>The words <i>Oh Eileen by the holy Christ I miss ya my
      sweet machree ah God so I do me own darlin&rsquo; girl</i>
      trembled unwailed in the air. He did miss the woman, too,
      especially her thigh and hip area and its oft-kneaded
      amplitudes, but not enough to call her up, or make (re-)
      overtures, not with her tendency to plunge into the warm bath
      of Monologue, or was it Soliloquy. . .God, was she a gabber,
      anyway, and getting worse with age.</p>

      <p>SO&mdash;</p>

      <p>He preferred to let things follow the zigzag route of
      their own unpredictability. The coffee-maker could wait its
      turn, or disappear entirely. And anyway My Three Buns, the
      place down the road, brewed up a matchless Arabica, or
      Colombian, or was it Brazilian&mdash;something hot, moist and
      dark, anyway, like the inside thigh of an Andalusian whore,
      plus caffeine. . .Mick, mentally stirred (if also slightly
      shaken) at this thought<a id="_ftnref4" href="#_ftn4"
      name="_ftnref4"
      title=""><![if !supportFootnotes]>[4]<![endif]></a>, whistled
      shrilly the second theme of Mimi and Rodolfo&rsquo;s love
      duet from <i>Madama Butterfly</i> by G. Puccini as he sought
      and successfully deployed navy tie, sky-blue shirt, and
      crimson underhose (with white piping). There ensued a quick
      tussle with the belt and trews, a smooth scrape of the
      stubble and the cursory tremor of a comb in the
      hair&mdash;and presto! <i>Mick McCreek reporting for duty,
      sir!</i> Not that he ever so reported, or called anyone
      &ldquo;sir;&rdquo; and of course the effing job was on the
      other side of town, and naturally <i>his</i> frigging car was
      in the shop, but what could you expect from a five year-old
      Jocelyn GT with twelve valves to the competition&rsquo;s
      twenty-four?</p>

      <p><i>No, it&rsquo;s the old No. 12 bus or shank&rsquo;s
      mare, mister me man.</i></p>

      <p>Well, anyway, first off was My Three Buns, the newly-chic
      trucker&rsquo;s caff down on Blessed Martin de Porres Street
      limned sketchily in Mick&rsquo;s mind&rsquo;s eye, the eye
      that never lied but was frequently blurred, more like a bad
      TV broadcast than the likes of a West of Ireland
      shanachee&rsquo;s meanderings, My Three Buns in reality being
      far less congenial than fondly depicted on the bloodshot
      eyeball of Mick&rsquo;s mind. There it basked in such
      clich&eacute;s as &ldquo;grotty but solid working-class
      ambience&rdquo; and &ldquo;down-to-earth unpretentious
      food.&rdquo; Truthfully, the place was a bit of a tip, and
      Devereux, the owner, was quite the rogue, a greedy sod
      anyway, boasting a rat-like and bewhiskered face above
      bulbous abdomen and thorax. His missus was no better, only
      cleaner-shaven, and with deeper cleavage in the chest area.
      They had kids, too, but that didn&rsquo;t bear thinking of. .
      .still, the fried bread was top-hole, and the eponymous buns,
      gooey as a bag of melted Mars Bars on the back seat of the
      family saloon in the summer sun: YUM!</p>

      <p>And none, however well-motivated, could come close to the
      bacon rinds, never mind your classic sunny side up with chips
      on the side. . .!</p>

      <p><i>Especially</i> those chips: salty, oily, limp: plain
      delicious!!!</p>

      <p><i>After all, it doesn&rsquo;t have to be good for you to
      be good, does it?<a id="_ftnref5" href="#_ftn5"
      name="_ftnref5"
      title=""><![if !supportFootnotes]>[5]<![endif]></a></i></p>

      <p>&ldquo;Yum! Oh yum!&rdquo;</p>

      <p>Mick was ready, oh he was agog, old tum agurgle, satchel
      at hand, keys ajingle. He checked the gas above and below,
      adjusted his tie and scampered delightedly into the
      dangerously random Great Outdoors, where it was blustery,
      rendering his tie a windsock, pointing due East. That way lay
      Wales, as usual, with England loitering beyond; here in
      Ireland&rsquo;s north-southeast it was a cracking fine day,
      what with a brisk wind that danced with the trees and lifted
      the leaves above the eaves. Not so bad for September the
      twentieth, when for all you knew it could plunge to five on
      the Celsius scale, the record for Killoyle city and environs,
      set a twelvemonth ago last September in the year of three
      governments. <a id="_ftnref6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6"
      title=""><![if !supportFootnotes]>[6]<![endif]></a></p>

      <p>Thanks be to God, a mere twenty-four solid Christian
      degrees it was, this breezy September morn.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Sure you&rsquo;d be hard pressed to do better in
      the south of France, or the Aegean itself,&rdquo; blurted
      Mick, fatuously.</p>

      <p>A quick step or so took him across Padre Pio Circus down
      Blessed Martin de Porres Street to the scaley shopfront
      behind which teemed My Three Buns&mdash;or rather, teemed
      not, for on that day of all blessed sunny days in the
      calendar there was a sign on the door. Mick, incredulous,
      peered, then peered closer.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Closed,&rdquo; said the sign, and repeated itself
      identically throughout subsequent double- and triple-takes.
      Through the window an ugly mug hovered, glowered, glared, and
      vanished behind a hastily-lowered blind.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Go away,&rdquo; came a muffled shout.</p>

      <p>Mick obeyed, dragging his feet, one more cosy plan up the
      spout. He dawdled not, for &ldquo;work&rdquo; (such as it
      was) was imminent, rendering breakfast urgent. He mentally
      perused the possibilities:</p>

      <p>There was The Bay Window, with its pseuds from Upper
      Killoyle College and prats from elsewhere.</p>

      <p>There was McSpackle&rsquo;s Cantina, on the Promenade,
      with its annoying Spanish decor.<a id="_ftnref7"
      href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7"
      title=""><![if !supportFootnotes]>[7]<![endif]></a></p>

      <p>There was the Koh-I-Noor, curry shop of the gods, run
      (actually) by that Indian berk from downstairs with the dicey
      Escort, but the Koh was better reserved for late-night
      homeward-bound stopoffs for Vindaloo and a six of lager.</p>

      <p>There was the snooty Balsa Room of the freshly renovated
      Spudorgan Vacation Inn, where a fiver might just get you a
      pot of coffee and a table away from the jakes (if you managed
      to find the good side of the freshly re-appointed Managing
      Director<a id="_ftnref8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8"
      title=""><![if !supportFootnotes]>[8]<![endif]></a>, Milo
      Rogers, no easy task&mdash;and wasn&rsquo;t Milo a hard man
      when he was at home, oh Christ he was that&hellip;or so they
      said, for Mick had never met the poet laureate of the
      Killoyle hotel business, but the man&rsquo;s reputation
      preceded (and followed) him like a gang of impecunious
      inebriates.<a id="_ftnref9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9"
      title=""><![if !supportFootnotes]>[9]<![endif]></a>)</p>

      <p>Finally, and more realistically, there was
      McShiny&rsquo;s. The American chain had opened a branch on
      King Idris Avenue (W.), which, given time-and-motion
      considerations (Mick was first test driver of the day of the
      new Asphodel LSI, and that in thirty-five minutes) would be
      the likeliest candidate for brekkers.</p>

      <p>And McShiny&rsquo;s it was. Blandly Americanesque in their
      good humour, the teens behind the counter somewhat oversold
      their product and the customer&rsquo;s pleasure in consuming
      it, their pseudo-conversation bookended with anodyne
      &ldquo;how are you today&rdquo;s and &ldquo;have a good
      day&rdquo;s designed to provoke the matutinal temper of your
      average mick; and Mick was nothing if not that.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take the Shiny Sausage,&rdquo; he
      muttered. &ldquo;And chips,&rdquo; he added, irritably.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Will that be the Super Shiny Sausage with Super
      Shiny Fries?&rdquo; inquired the adolescent, plunging Mick
      into an agony of indecision and despair.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know. How big is it? Oh, all
      right.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>As he ate the Super Shiny Sausage&mdash;nearly a foot long
      and encased in a warm sticky bun apparently made of some kind
      of molten yet edible (just) plastic&mdash;across the linoleum
      his furtive gaze steadied its focus onto a pair of neat
      feminine legs, neatly crossed, attached to a felicitous lady
      whose glance was at once winsome and willing. Red-haired was
      she, and buxom, and greeny-blue of eye; and she purported to
      be perusing a copy of <i>Glam</i>.<a id="_ftnref10"
      href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10"
      title=""><![if !supportFootnotes]>[10]<![endif]></a></p>

      <p><i>Now none of that, boyo,</i> grumbled the once-uxorious
      censor in Mick&rsquo;s brain, where the spirit of Eileen
      still flitted free (as free as she was now in the bloody
      wynds and backways of Edinburgh...?); <i>sod it</i>,
      countered the opposition, voice of gruff maleness open to a
      pint and a quick fondle any time mate, day or night. <i>Nice
      piece</i>, pursued that voice, offensively. To ward off
      panic, Mick turned his eyes to a copy of the <i>Killoyle
      Clarion</i> that lay abandoned on the next table.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;City Picked as Site of Olympics,&rdquo; confided
      the headlines.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Cripes,&rdquo; exclaimed Mick.</p>

      <p>Not <i>the</i> Olympics, as further perusal revealed, but
      the World Pint-Pulling Olympiad, no small event when you
      stopped to consider the attendance at your average boozer in
      any Irish town any day of the week, never mind during an
      event when the stout flowed like the waters of the East
      Killoyle River for five days running and free pints were
      handed out like trophies on Derby Day, with the grand prize a
      wee pub of one&rsquo;s own, location to be designated by the
      judges; ah a pub, thought Mick dreamily, like the Lusitania
      in Listowel, or Harvey&rsquo;s Bar in Bundoran, or
      McCracken&rsquo;s on the Diamond in Omagh<a id="_ftnref11"
      href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11"
      title=""><![if !supportFootnotes]>[11]<![endif]></a>...</p>

      <p>The lady with the legs went out, using those very legs to
      precise locomotive effect.</p>

      <p>Mick sighed, riven by waves of nostalgia, lust, and acid
      reflux.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Well, I drink Coke because my mum drinks
      Coke,&rdquo; explained a teenaged girl to another teenaged
      girl behind him. &ldquo;She says it has less carbonation than
      Pepsi.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Cool,&rdquo; said her friend.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Ah, Christ,&rdquo; said Mick.</p>

      <p>He rose, dabbing his lips. His system reacted to the hasty
      ingestion of sausage grease plus chips with a gaseous
      detonation. The girls giggled.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Beg pardon.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>Making haste, ten minutes later he was at the Jocelyn
      works and behind the wheel of the world&rsquo;s first
      production-model Asphodel TTX. Pats Bewley the testing
      supervisor, red-faced with impatience, was clutching his
      clipboard and emitting a faint hissing sound through his
      lower mandibles. As usual, Mick noted irritably, he was
      wearing a shirt with cross-hatching and a shite-brown tie
      misknotted entirely and only coming down to the middle of his
      chest. Mick hated Pats Bewley on general principles, because
      Bewley was a prat, but more specifically because he was a
      known non-drinker and hearty-Harry type of sanctimonious
      churchgoing hill-climbing Pioneer arsehole with a full
      complement of manly condescension and salutary anecdotes for
      the less-advantaged, i.e., drinkers, smokers, freethinkers,
      and all the plain people of Ireland.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Ah, there you are, McCreek,&rdquo; said Bewley.
      &ldquo;Another five minutes and I&rsquo;d have given the
      drive to Driscoll. Always almost late, aren&rsquo;t
      you?&rdquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Kiss my arse.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I mean. That attitude. No manners
      to speak of, and what&rsquo;s that on your tie? Now,
      there&rsquo;s the car. Take her up to speed, but watch the
      brakes. New antilocks are always chancey lads, I don&rsquo;t
      have to tell you that. And watch the lean on
      corners.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>Pats stood aside and placed a complacent check mark on the
      checklist of his clipboard: 08:46; Tester McCreek at the
      wheel; all three liters and sixteen valves of the Asphodel
      LSI ready to throb; nine miles on the clock. The Asphodel was
      the first of a projected new generation of Jocelyns, uniting
      elements of the jeep, the claw-footed bathtub, and the family
      saloon, and powered as it was by a unique seven-cylinder
      engine developed exclusively at Jocelyn Motors. The
      inverted-bathtub-like bonnet displayed a scooped-out air
      intake like the entrance to a cave, and the roof wore a
      gnarled-steel crown of gleaming aluminium tubes. Thick manly
      or womanly tyres and shining alloy wheels squatting beneath
      bold wing flares hinted at the no-nonsense stance of a barge
      designed for high speeds and deep road-rutting.<a
      id="_ftnref12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12"
      title=""><![if !supportFootnotes]>[12]<![endif]></a> Also,
      chrome abounded, not least inside, where Mick already had a
      headache from the glare.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Too much fuckin&rsquo; chrome in here, Pats,&rdquo;
      he said. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Get on wichya, McCreek,&rdquo; snapped Pats.
      &ldquo;Put on yer shades, then. And mind the
      brakes.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>Displaying a profile of haughty indifference to
      Bewley&rsquo;s nagging, Mick drove off and motored about
      stylishly for a while, imagining an audience of girls. Oh,
      the machine would make a less demanding man quite happy, he
      reckoned. Just the thing for the Philistines who littered the
      world&rsquo;s computer shops and university science
      departments, the T-shirted, unkempt, TV- and video-obsessed
      imbeciles with their baseball caps and dirt bikes and bungee
      jumps, the miserable half-witted wee nerds. . . Truth to
      tell, Mick, a lover of cars, nevertheless dreamed not of
      Asphodels, nor of any Jocelyn. A Merc was his motor, black,
      preferably, with silver paneling, and chrome-tipped dual
      exhausts, and one of those smooth German clutchless
      shifters.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;d be the man, all right.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>Mick whistled in atonal counterpoint to the overture to G.
      Rossini&rsquo;s <i>L&rsquo;Italiana in</i> <i>Algeri</i>
      rollicking away on Breakfast Classics 105.5 FM.<a
      id="_ftnref13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13"
      title=""><![if !supportFootnotes]>[13]<![endif]></a> The
      traffic was light at that time of day in most parts of town
      and almost nonexistent on the MacLiammoir Ring Road, from
      which vantage point there was a grand view of the sea. As a
      red light lingered, Mick stared at the view, one of the best
      things about living in this Godforsaken shithole of a town
      (no Milan, you can bet yer bags). Whatever his preoccupations
      of the moment, he always gave the view from the MacLiammoir
      Road a glance of admiration, especially when there was a
      chance, as there was on extra-clear days, of spotting Wales
      on the far horizon of fact and fantasy, like Avalon, or
      Hybrassil&mdash;in fact, as he watched, a layer of mist
      peeled away and <i>presto!</i> Thar she blew, a thin layer of
      crust on the distant line of the sea. It was an inspiring
      sight: <i>Cymru!</i> The imagination, if so instructed, might
      even supply the distant sound of massed baritones lustily
      rendering <i>Men of Harlech</i> in the melancholy valleys of
      South Rhondda and Gwynedd...my oh my, ruminated Mick, not for
      the first time. So it was across this sea that Tristan sailed
      to his Isolde&rsquo;s Cornwall and did battle with stout King
      Mark; that bloody Cromwell came, in the wake of the
      even-bloodier Vikings; that the Normans came, too, and
      conquered; that, some day long since, the original Celts had
      arrived from God knows where to rout the small dusky natives
      from the cosy comfort of their bogs; and it was over this
      selfsame sea that the former Mrs. Eileen McCreek, fed up with
      her quondam hubby&rsquo;s obstinacy of habit and innate lack
      of ambition, had, in the tradition of the modern Irish exile,
      sailed away on the midnight ferry from Dun Laoighaire, away
      from her green land, toward a greener love, to Edinburgh,
      city of Boswell and Burns and the whiskey distiller or beer
      salesman or whatever the blazes he was who had tempted her to
      sacrifice so much so soon. . .</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Ah, ya sod.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>(It <i>was</i> a relief to be shut of her blathering, but.
      Talk about carping.)</p>

      <p>The sun, as previously noted, was shining full force. The
      liquid silver sea and the chrome fittings inside the car
      formed a confluence of brilliance that had Mick, sunglasses
      or not, quite blinded by the time the horns started honking
      behind him like hungry geese. In his rear-view an oddly
      distorted face behind the wheel of what appeared to be a
      1970s-era Fiat convertible snarled silently.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;All right, all right. Jaysus.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>Seeing little in front of his eyes but a flock of
      reddish-blue flying mice, Mick yielded to driver&rsquo;s
      instinct and coordinated clutch pedal, gearshift and
      accelerator in your standard departure mode, following which
      forward progress was normal if slightly jerky (he made a
      mental note: too-long throws on the gearbox) for all of one
      and half seconds&mdash;the interlude between Normality and
      Disaster, like the final pre-iceberg half-hour of the
      Titanic&rsquo;s voyage, or John Kennedy&rsquo;s last wave of
      the hand on Dealey Plaza, or the still moments just previous
      to the explosion of TWA Flight 800&mdash;when into
      Mick&rsquo;s life lumbered Fate in the guise of a) sluggish
      brakes, per the warning issued by Pats Bewley; b) Francis
      Feeley, apprentice bartender at Mad Molloy&rsquo;s Bar,
      embarking upon a last-minute, hare-brained dash across the
      street against the pedestrian light; c) the sunlight
      ricocheting off the sea, the dashboard, divers chrome
      fittings, and straight into Mick&rsquo;s eyes.</p>

      <p>There came a crump and a yell, coincident with reflexive
      mashing of the brakes. At the front there was a soft jolt,
      behind a bang. A man was down, and Mick had been
      rear-ended.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Ignorant snail-eating foreign bastards,&rdquo;
      shrieked the driver of the aged rag-top behind, an epicene
      young man with large hands and nervous eyes and, it seemed
      blurrily to Mick, rouge, heavy lipstick and eye shadow.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d take a crow bar to you French fuckers if I
      had one, so I would. Go back to Cannes, you garlic-eater.
      <i>Allez vous-en</i>, Monsieur Le Poof
      Fran&ccedil;ais.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Shite,&rdquo; said Mick.</p>

      <p>Preliminary investigation revealed signs of life behind
      the closed lids of the supine form on the street. A Garda
      arrived, soon followed by an ambulance.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be charged, you,&rdquo; said the
      policeman, who appeared to be acquainted with the injured
      man. &ldquo;Mother of God, it&rsquo;s Frank. Frankie, lad,
      speak to me. Aye. Charged, so you&rsquo;ll be. So no
      wanderin&rsquo; off. You stay right here, eh, Mr.
      eh?&rdquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;McCreek.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Greek. It&rsquo;s a bad case, so it is. I&rsquo;d
      not be surprised if poor wee Frankie was dead, God bless and
      save us.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;But he&rsquo;s not dead. Look, he&rsquo;s sitting
      up already.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Are you the one who ploughed into me, then? You
      bastard, you damn near did for me, did you know
      that?&rdquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Not ailing in the slightest, to judge by the vigour
      of his vocabulary.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Vigour me arse. You&rsquo;re a right bastard. I
      can&rsquo;t move me legs. Listen here you. If I&rsquo;m
      paralyzed, I&rsquo;ll sue you for every penny you&rsquo;re
      worth. Ah, hello there. Is it yourself, Petey?&rdquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Just you lie back now, Frank. We&rsquo;ll see to it
      this fella&rsquo;s charged to the fullest extent of the
      law.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Look, officer, this pal of yours jumped out in
      front of me after the light changed. And I couldn&rsquo;t see
      anything anyway, with the sun shining in my eyes.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s quite enough out of you. And
      he&rsquo;s no pal of mine, I&rsquo;ll have you know, so never
      mind them accusations. He&rsquo;s me brother-in-law, Mr.
      Greek.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Mc<i>Creek</i>. Jesus Mary and Joseph.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>Briefly, Mick found himself in a world of Kafkaesque
      disjointedness in which for no apparent reason he had become
      the scapegoat of public ire.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Go back to Paris, you,&rdquo; screamed the
      rear-ender, who by this time had stepped out of his car into
      full sunlight which clearly illuminated the make-up that
      overlay his features: lavish blood-red lipstick; black
      eyeliner; more than a hint of blush on the cheekbones...in
      another microscene stage-managed by the ghost of Franz K.,<a
      id="_ftnref14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14"
      title=""><![if !supportFootnotes]>[14]<![endif]></a> no one
      but Mick seemed to notice.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Listen to that music he&rsquo;s got on,&rdquo;
      clamored the made-up man. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m telling you, I can
      spot &lsquo;em every time.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Now calm down there,&rdquo; said the guard.
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;d like you to come along and give a statement
      as well. And don&rsquo;t worry, this man&rsquo;s on me
      list.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;What list?&rdquo; bawled Mick. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
      been tried and convicted before I&rsquo;ve even had a chance
      to defend myself. As for this, this. . .&rdquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;What was that. I&rsquo;m not above administering a
      bit of physical restraint, I&rsquo;ll have you know,
      especially to recalcitrant wee spalpeens like
      yerself.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Lay a finger on me and I&rsquo;ll have your fucking
      badge.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Make way, now.&rdquo; An ambulanceman checked
      Mick&rsquo;s blood pressure and, alarmed, ordered him to the
      hospital. He also suggested an X-ray.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;You never know, sir. The owld whiplash can muck you
      up.&rdquo;<a id="_ftnref15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15"
      title=""><![if !supportFootnotes]>[15]<![endif]></a></p>

      <p>In the event, Mick was charged with &ldquo;reckless
      endangerment of the public welfare with a weapon the exact
      size and shape of a motor vehicle.&rdquo; A breathalyser test
      revealed total sobriety, and after an hour or so he was
      released on his own recognizance, with a warning not to leave
      the limits of Co. Killoyle. He promptly declared his
      intention to seek legal counsel and have the onus of
      misdemeanour shifted to the persons of Francis Feeley,
      perambulating barman, and Cornelius Regan, rear-ending (as it
      turned out) church sexton.</p>

      <p>Mick repeated this plan to Pats Bewley when Pats came to
      tow away the injured Shilellagh, and Pats was quite candid in
      turn.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Well, Mick, you&rsquo;re sacked.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Aw give us a break, Pats.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Given you enough breaks, lad. And look at you.
      Always late, or almost. Nearly cheeky every time you open
      your mouth. And if you drank on the job you&rsquo;d be the
      world&rsquo;s biggest absenteeist, I can feel it in my bones.
      There&rsquo;s always something you&rsquo;d just be about to
      do. I can&rsquo;t put my finger on it, but it&rsquo;s there
      somewhere. You&rsquo;re like one of them Yanks that go over
      the edge and turn up at their old place of employment with
      guns blazing. And the dear knows the number of times
      you&rsquo;ve almost wrecked your test vehicles.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Bastard.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Aye, well, it&rsquo;s a hard world, lad.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>Mick&rsquo;s blood pressure was still &ldquo;a bit to
      mostly sky-high,&rdquo; they told him at the Mater
      Misericordiae Hospital, and although preliminary examination
      revealed nothing, he should, they said, take a day off and
      rest at home.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Well, absolutely no problem there. My employer has
      seen to that.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>Moreover, home was where Mick yearned to be, with the
      world suddenly turning on him the way it had. Home, and the
      locked front door, were the best guards against the infinite
      bothersomeness of things. Blinds down, too, and a
      freshly-rinsed glass, and soothing murmur from Fran Leeson on
      the telly at that time of day: talk time on <i>Talk Me Talk
      You</i> (RTE Channel 4A). The subject was Societal
      Inebriative Dysfunction, or SID.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Inebriated what? Oo&rsquo;s Sid?&rdquo;</p>

      <p>Mick only twigged to what they were on about when one of
      the lady guests held up an empty bottle of Jameson&rsquo;s
      and announced that she had once gone through two of them a
      day.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;And did your husband suspect?&rdquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Suspect?&rdquo; A tobacco-hoarsened wheeze of
      laughter like the air brakes of a coal lorry.
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t he start me on the bloody stuff? The
      bastard.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>Reassured, Mick chuckled and turned to pour an additional
      glass of liquid comfort from his own bottle, not
      Jameson&rsquo;s as it happened but a fine smooth
      Paddy&rsquo;s, and with a few water crackers to hold things
      together down there by Janey it was going down as smooth as
      buttermilk from the great dun cow of Connacht.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Ah God,&rdquo; blubbered Mick. He then found
      himself dissolving into stuttering hysterics. Somehow the
      reflection in the TV screen, glimpsed during an all-black
      commercial for eau de cologne, of his own shirtless form,
      pale face, and general air of decrepitude, yet seated in (he
      recognized the association and its absurdity at the same
      time) the precise pose of Gertrude Stein in Picasso&rsquo;s
      Cubist portrait of that manly gal, brought home in a vivid
      and pictorial way the multifarious actual and potential
      nastinesses of his own situation, and Life&rsquo;s abusive
      absurdities in general.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Shite. Bastards. Fuck you, Pats Bewley.&rdquo;<a
      id="_ftnref16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16"
      title=""><![if !supportFootnotes]>[16]<![endif]></a></p>

      <p>He tipped another short one down his throat and gave
      himself up to random thoughts of despair.</p>

      <p>Sacked!</p>

      <p><i>Un-fucking-employed</i>!!</p>

      <p>On the Sosh!!!</p>

      <p>He&rsquo;d end up like his father, a jobless chancer with
      one foot on the barrail and the other in the grave, creator
      of his own legend and two martyrs: his wife, his son...and
      here Mick&rsquo;s lot in life was turning into the bit of a
      disgrace, as well, what with Eileen dumping him for a job in
      Scotland (and that job&rsquo;s gruff, manly Scots overseer,
      Sean bloody Connery in a suit and tie, och aye the noo) and
      himself being nearly broke anyway, the consequences of
      divorce leeching away the larger part of his puny savings and
      the rest siphoned off by his own natural disinclination to
      put anything aside, <i>carpe diem, fay ce que voudras</i>,
      hasn&rsquo;t the owld motor gone long enough without a fine
      set of alloys, and I always fancied one of those multi-CD
      changers, and Hanna&rsquo;s just got in a Kavanagh first
      edition. . . of course, even at the end of the line there
      were the soft nannying hands of Ireland&rsquo;s welfare
      state, of whose generosity toward her citizens Mick McCreek
      had taken advantage often enough in the past, starting
      without hesitation soon after graduating from TCD with a
      degree in Classical Architecture (from Vitruvius to Palladio,
      inclusive) that&mdash;like all college degrees bar those in
      the applied sciences&mdash;turned out to be quite useless
      except for purposes of adding a dash of spurious learning to
      barroom blather. Anyway, he&rsquo;d used his money from the
      Sosh, plus a packet borrowed from home, to go to Italy to
      visit Elide, a girl he&rsquo;d met on the windy heights of
      Howth Head, the both of them en route to the Abbey Tavern for
      good crack of a Saturday night (Christy Moore, De Danaan);
      and when Mick visited and, intending marriage, wooed his
      Elide in her noble home town of Milan, he went out to Monza
      and saw Ferraris and Alfa Romeos being put through their
      paces and even drove a Dino (hers) at high speed along the
      cypress-lined highways of Lombardy and Emilia-Romagna from
      Milan&rsquo;s Piazza del Duomo straight down to rich,
      wine-redolent Parma and Bologna; and that was that. From then
      on he was hooked. Something of the same aesthetic-scientific
      appeal that had drawn him to buildings attracted him to cars,
      a union of the fabulous and the everyday, with a heavy dose
      of vanity, as in sartorial taste, also an Italian specialty.
      More importantly, he&rsquo;d absorbed the neo-pagan
      half-adoring, half-cynical attitude Italians have not only to
      cars but to life in general. A young Irishman like Mick
      McCreek was a blank slate indeed, back in the early
      &lsquo;70s when Ireland herself was only just ungumming her
      weary age-old eyes and taking in the new dawn of things. .
      .then <i>Il Capo</i>, Elide&rsquo;s father, also known behind
      his back as <i>Il Duce</i>, sussing out Mick&rsquo;s
      earnestness vis-a-vis his little girl, had one night over
      <i>tortellini in brodo</i> (washed down with a crisp
      Lambrusco<a id="_ftnref17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17"
      title=""><![if !supportFootnotes]>[17]<![endif]></a>) proudly
      announced the existence of Commendatore Spadolini, an
      appointed future son-in-law then in the high command of the
      <i>Squadra Volante</i>, and with that, or shortly thereafter,
      in an atmosphere of peerless awkwardness and sweaty palms
      (his), Mick left, via Geneva; but in his dreams he visited
      the glorious peninsula yet, wandering across the geometrical
      shadows of De Chirico piazzas and driving that red Dino south
      along the cypress-lined highways of an Italianate heaven.</p>

      <p>But most importantly, he&rsquo;d also lost his virginity
      on that little jaunt (late night; the family <i>casa</i> in
      San Donato Milanese; her room, adorned with posters of the
      same rock stars who adorned the bedroom walls of Killoyle
      bungalows; dead silence bar the act itself and the distant
      ebb and flow of a televisual laughtrack in <i>Il
      Duce</i>&rsquo;s parlour) which had forever, for one thing,
      ended Mick&rsquo;s blinkered Irish suspicion of the world and
      all its foreigners.<a id="_ftnref18" href="#_ftn18"
      name="_ftnref18"
      title=""><![if !supportFootnotes]>[18]<![endif]></a></p>

      <p>Otherwise, he&rsquo;d made a bags of the whole business,
      as he had the rest of his life, or so it seemed through the
      prism of the whiskey glass.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Elide,&rdquo; he elided elliptically, quite
      langered&mdash;and it scarcely three p.m., for
      goodness&rsquo; sake.</p>

        Looney, then a bloke named O&rsquo;Hair they found
        stretched out down by the North Wall, then Gar again, plus
        O&rsquo;Hair in the wings. When they found Gar to call him
        back to Leinster House, he was at his customary post in
        Flood&rsquo;s Bar, back turned to the hoi polloi and
        standing with a pronounced list to the left so as to get a
        better view of the telly above the bar, more specifically
        the Hurling Special on TV3 followed by An Nuacht on Channel
        2A (Gaeilge). In his left hand was his third pint of the
        day, in his right his thirtieth fag of the twenty per diem
        he then allowed himself (he quit soon after, only to start
        up again under the menace of peace arrangements north of
        the Border and the concomitant necessity to hobnob with
        Unionists). Well, when the parliamentary committee
        approached him he pretended at first to be someone else
        entirely&mdash;a Japanese businessman, I think, complete
        with eyes and accent&mdash;then took off at a sprint
        through the side door but ran headlong into the arms of the
        law (Sgt. Liam Paterson, shaking off). &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a

        bastard O&rsquo;Hair, and that&rsquo;s final.&rdquo;

        1958 Kilkenny hurling champion. He had a brief run on the
        gogglebox, as well, if memory serves. Something to do with
        a cookery program perilously poised opposite la Finnucane
        on the other channel that collapsed after one episode when
        he&rsquo;d used up his two recipes (cold cuts on a bed of
        oatmeal and colcannon <i>potag</i>e). Anyhow, he fell ill
        all of a sudden like, overnight, in the pink one day and
        death&rsquo;s doorman the next. Sudden depression combined
        with an acute inflammation of the long urinary basin, most
        likely, according to his doctor, Seoirse
        &ldquo;Peachy&rdquo; O Buitlear, according to whom also
        Tadgh was heard to announce from his hospital bed, in an
        unexpectedly loud and clear baritone, &ldquo;Stout
        isn&rsquo;t poured at McTowel&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s milked
        from the great tits of Mother Ireland herself,&rdquo; upon
        which he sat up and stared straight ahead in horror, then
        fell back&mdash;dead.</p>

        bloody yawn. Get on with it, can&rsquo;t you? If I wanted
        to read this automotive rubbish I&rsquo;d have gone out and
        bought a copy of <i>Motorself</i> or <i>Speedstick
        Revue</i> or <i>GT</i> <i>Slushbox</i> or another of them
        auto mags written by, and for, teenage boys with a wanking
        problem and bad skin. Enough&rsquo;s sufficient, mister me
        man. Bloody cars anyhow, eh? Good for going from A to B but
        that&rsquo;s where the problems usually start, isn&rsquo;t
        it, just outside B on a cold and rainy night with yours
        truly squatting on his hunkers wrestling with the bloody
        tyre jack not to mention two grimy wheels, a tyre iron and
        a tyre flat as me owld auntie Clarissa&rsquo;s chest Cars,
        is it? I had one once. . .but hang on a sec. If
        you&rsquo;re a Kantian, as I suspect you are, you&rsquo;ll
        be muttering about me not separating cars, as "things in
        themselves," from my experience with cars, i.e. "things as
        they are for us," or, in other words, failing to
        distinguish the noumenal from the phenomenal, as it were. I
        should be seeing (you&rsquo;ll no doubt go on to say) space
        and time as the forms of our sensibility, imposed on the
        noumenal world as a condition of our experience of it. Fair
        enough. But I still had a hell of a time with the spare
        tyre on the outskirts of B, that rainy New Year&rsquo;s
        night long ago. That was noumenous enough for me, I can
        tell you. And thus do I clear my mind of Kant.</p>

        <i>I</i> don&rsquo;t know. Thanks to those high-speed
        motoring nightmares of mine, I&rsquo;ve had whiplash every
        night of my life and damn the harm it&rsquo;s ever done me.
        The only real problem was a twisted knee after one
        particularly harrowing night going through the Arnage bend
        at Le Mans during a rainstorm in what I&rsquo;d thought was
        a &lsquo;67 Lotus Brabham but turned out to be a &lsquo;76

        That&rsquo;s telling &lsquo;em, boy. I used identical
        language when Management, in the form of a slope-shouldered
        article named Stiles, threw me out of Pucker&rsquo;s Steel
        Pens and Quill Manufactory after employing me for three
        days on on the assumption that I was Ernie Eames, whereas I
        was, and am, not, and whereas Ernie, as it transpired, had
        moved to the Greater Inishbofin area to try his hand at the
        repair and maintenance of nets.</p>

        about ten p.m. on June 15th of that year, and didn&rsquo;t

        and kept on staring at me, like I was some kind of sodding
        exhibit. I told him to piss off, but no, it was
        &ldquo;Oo-oo&rdquo; again and the unblinking stare, like a
        sheep on a hillside, then &ldquo;Oo-oo&rdquo; and eyes the
        size of bloody soup plates. Finally I had to leave the
        bathhouse entirely and dry off outside.</p>
