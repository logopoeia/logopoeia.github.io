    <p style="color: #999999"><cite>The Great Pint-Pulling
      Olympiad, A Mostly Irish Farce</cite> was published under
    the title <cite>R&uuml;ckkehr nach Killoyle, Eine vorwiegend
      irische Farce</cite> in German
    translation in December 2002 (by Verlag Rogner und Bernhard,
    Hamburg). It will be published in English by Grove Press in
    2003.</p>

    <p>Mick McCreek and Anil Swain are neighbors in a block of
    flats in the lovely, nonexistent Irish city of Killoyle. Mick
    is a man's man&mdash;and a ladies' one, too, when occasion
    permits&mdash;but not much of a one for the old nine-to-five.
    Indeed, in the very first chapter he manages to get sacked from
    his job as car tester at Jocelyn Motors after running over a
    man at a traffic light. This leads to complications, personal
    and legal, from which Mick emerges, triumphant and mostly
    sober, at the end of a long meander into and out of various
    bedrooms, pubs, and places of employment.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>In the course of all this Anil Swain, formerly of
    Sandrapore, India, tries to take over by force the Indian
    restaurant where he is employed as a waiter. (Being a waiter
    confers a lowly status that embarrasses his snobbish wife
    Rubina, proud Brahmin.) This caper puts Anil in jail, from
    which he is released on bail by a father-and-son team of legal
    con artists, the O'Mallets <i>p&egrave;re et fils</i>, who need
    someone to drive a van full of weapons. The O'Mallets are
    on-and-off legal counsel and front men for the Provisional IRA,
    but they've gone greedy and decide to do a little number on the
    arms cache entrusted to them by the Hard Men up North, who want
    to pass as peacemakers (while still keeping the stuff handy,
    just in case). Complications ensue, bringing out of the
    woodwork sundry blackguards and international terrorists. By
    dint of total incompetence combined with sheer blind luck, Anil
    survives, barely; but the O'Mallets, who&rsquo;ve been playing
    a very dangerous game, get their comeuppance.</p>

    <p>Milo Rogers, poet, hotel manager, and anti-hero of
    <i>Killoyle</i>, returns by popular demand as the footnote
    commentator in <cite>The Great Pint-Pulling Olympiad</cite>
    and graciously provides us in the final chapter with a
    summation of the entire narrative in mock-epic verse form, in
    which are parodied many styles of Irish verse through the
    ages, from the <i>Tain</i> to Patrick Kavanagh&mdash;and
    beyond.</p>

<p>The <a href="sample.html">prologue and first
chapter</a> of the book are also available at this site.</p>
