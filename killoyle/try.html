<strong>By Roger Boylan</strong></div>
<br>
<br>
<br>
     Like Castle Dracula, or the Bates mansion in <cite>Psycho</cite>, Spudorgan Hall
stood out in stark relief atop its looming escarpment <a name="fnB0"
href="#fn0">[1]</a>, lit up in the lightning glare that alternated with the
barrel-hollow grumbling and asthmatic throat-clearings of distant (but
approaching) thunder. It was a quite entertaining phase of the autumnal
equinox, <a name="fnB1" href="#fn1">[2]</a> especially if viewed from behind
twitching lace curtains, or trembling roller blinds--at any rate, more edifying
than the telly for the guests at the Hall, as it was for all the snug
homebodies and smug early-to-bedders throughout Killoyle city and South-Eastern
Ireland and out to sea almost as far as Wales. Decidedly not entertained,
however--although likewise sporadically illuminated--was homeward-bound Milo
Rogers, Spudorgan Hall's headwaiter and his own occasional poet and dreamer
extraordinaire. Nearing the topmost corner of Uphill Street (a real slog, in
that wind), he took a cigarette out of his coat pocket and cursed the fates
that a) allowed his last fag to be waterlogged b) did likewise to his matches
and c) ordered the pubs closed at such a sodbuggering early hour--and on his
night off, for the love of God. <a name="fnB2" href="#fn2">[3]</a> </div>
<br>
<div>
     "Ballocks," he howled. The thunder burped, sarcastically.</div>
<br>
<div>
     Of course, there were the after-hours clubs on Parnell Parade, where for a
cover charge that would buy you a weekend on the Riviera, including airfare and
several Blue Ribbon dinners, you could sit until 2 a.m. and guzzle yourself
into oblivion and beyond; but Milo, shameless Saturday night inebriate that he
was, nevertheless retained enough self-respect to avoid clip joints of that
class. Imagine expecting the likes of him to part with good money to buy
vintage Canada Dry or Schweppes "champagne" for some raddled slut he'd probably
see Monday lunchtime coughing into her fried cod at the Crubeeneria<a
name="fnB3" href="#fn3">[4]</a> down the street! Moreover (crucially), Milo was
nearly penniless, this particular Saturday being equidistant between
fortnightly paydays at Spudorgan Hall. In any event (i.e., conclusively), he
was already standing at the intersection of Uphill Street (Ir.<em>Sra&igrave;d
Upha&igrave;l</em>)--alias the N6 Waxford-Dublin dual carriageway <a name="fnB4"
href="#fn4">[5]</a>--and the T45 Killoyle-Cork ring road <a name="fnB5"
href="#fn5">[6]</a>, half a mile and more from Killoyle town centre--comprising
O'Connell Square, Parnell Parade, Pollexfen Walk, Brendan Behan Avenue, St.
Derek's (C. of I.), St. Oinsias' (R.C.), SS. Peter &amp; Laurence O'Toole's
(R.C.), and the lower approaches to King Idris Road (E. &amp; W.)--and mere
seconds away from the front door of his house at No. 7b, Oxtail Yard--well,
"house" is perhaps putting it a bit strongly. The "b" in the address pretty
much sums it up.</div>
<br>
<div>
     Still (he thought), things could be worse. Reassuringly, they were, as
soon as the storm hit Killoyle proper instead of loitering timidly in the
outskirts like a country cousin, but by that time Milo had bowed to the
inevitable and regained his domain to enjoy the dubious delights of television
from Wales--beamed weakly across St. George's Channel from the Principality
itself <a name="fnB6" href="#fn6">[7]</a>--and his own Three-Star Home Brew, a
guaranteed tummy-tickler <a name="fnB7" href="#fn7">[8]</a>. </div>
<br>
<div>
     "Blow, wind, and crack your cheeks," muttered Milo, as the gale raged
outside. On the screen flickered a flick featuring big-nosed Spencer Tracy,
like his erstwhile character Daniel Boone wearing a coonskin hat, itself
sporting a coonskin tail. Caucasian extras, clumsily made up to resemble Red
Indians, huddled together in the damp forests of Upstate New York (in reality
the San Fernando Valley, plus decor), plotting evilly against fork-tongued
Paleface (Messrs. Boone/Tracy). Arrows flew; a cannon barked; death was shammed
in awkward poses athwart the studio floor. The heroic music of Erich Korngold<a
name="fnB8" href="#fn8">[9]</a> overflowed the soundtrack, flooding
broad-nostrilled Spence as he shared the pipe of peace with an obvious Nordic
(indeed, Celtic) specimen daubed a sporadic shite-brown color that inexplicably
left patches of European pallor exposed: one by his left earlobe, another on
his neck, a third up by his daringly low hairline <a name="fnB9"
href="#fn9">[10]</a>   .&nbsp;.&nbsp.&nbsp;it was ludicrous, absurd, a disgrace! </div>
<br>
<div>
     The thunder crackled, snored, eructated hugely. Rain lashed the windows
with pent-up sadism. The gas fire was burbling comfortably, releasing frequent
hiccups in sympathy with the wind. Past time for a refill, said Milo to
himself. He made this declaration aloud, although to the best of his knowledge
there was no one in any of the bungalow's three rooms to hear him.</div>
<br>
<div>
     "Time for a refill, eh, me man?" he repeated. His voice boomed hollow in
his empty glass. Nodding in self-agreement, he squeezed his generous bulk out
of his armchair and swept majestically from the parlor into the vestibule and
thence to the kitchen, abode of (reading from left to right): <a name="fnB10"
href="#fn10">[11]</a> a Frigidaire, vintage 1962; closets dating from the
founding of Oxtail Corners, <em>circa</em> 1976, which year also saw the razing
of a dwelling from the Georgian period and in its place the raising of No. 7b,
a lopsided bungalow better suited to the Curragh <a name="fnB11"
href="#fn11">[12]</a>, or infamous holiday camps on England's South Coast
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;
next, the microwave (Hatichi, '87), head cheerleader among the bachelor's
friends, always on hand to dish up a lukewarm snack of boxty, or colcannon and
broth; the sink, with refitted taps, hot, cold and in-between; above the sink,
a window, at that moment framing a pinkish-white face with anxiously wandering
eyes; next to the sink, a broom closet, rarely entered, containing dusty pails,
a dryish mop and three yards of twine, but nary a broom in the two years and a
bit Milo had been <em>in situ</em> (he Hoovered instead, at an incredible rate);
a mid-sixties Hoover, leaning drunkenly against the kitchen's pi&egrave;ce de
r&eacute;sistance: the stove. A real turn-of-the-century masterpiece, this
beauty was hammered out of a single sheet of drop-forged steel back in 1896 (or
was it '97?) by MacSweeney of Chicago and miraculously salvaged from the other
house <a name="fnB12" href="#fn12">[13]</a> just in time to be connected to
existing gas mains under the thick macadam of Oxtail Terrace (adjacent to the
Yard) <a name="fnB13" href="#fn13">[14]</a>. Intended for display rather than
use, it squatted across from its distant descendant, the Hatichi microwave,
which gazed back, exuding the callow superiority of its generation.</div>
<br>
<div>
     The floor featured tiles, hexagonal in shape, some with intriguing whorls
of ancient grime embedded in the fading interstices.            </div>
<br>
<div>
     Milo turned on the light in the kitchen. Out of a charitable impulse to
amuse the solitary spectator he took at first to be his own image reflected in
the darkened windowpane, he fell into Quasimodo pose--one shoulder upraised,
knuckles of opposing hand grazing the floor, facial distortion <a name="fnB14"
href="#fn14">[15]</a>  accompanied by hoarse cackling--and lurched towards the
sink, beneath which a little brown jug of fresh homebrew awaited his
attentions. Before he could proceed further, however, he froze, rooted to the
spot. Electrified insects danced along his spine; sweat teased his palms; his
intestines shrank in on themselves in the immanence of fear. It was no
reflection after all:<em> there was a face at the window!</em></div>
<br>
<div>
It was only Murphy, but still&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;!</div>
<br>
<div>
     "What the blazes are you playing at?" inquired Milo, unheard through the
closed window. Once open, it admitted a swaggering gust of midnight storm, as
well as a few stray leaves and, one leg nimbly preceding him: Murphy, Peter X.
of that name, fellow-Dubliner, fellow-Northsider and chief barman at Spudorgan
Hall. Milo repeated his question.</div>
<br>
<div>
     "What am <em>I</em> playing at?" echoed Murphy. With meticulous irony, he
briefly but masterfully aped Milo's apish gait. "You're well away, aren't you,
Milo. Could I, ah?" He straightened his back and shot a significant look
towards the sinkside homebrew. "As long as you're having one, like." </div>
<br>
<div>
     When interrogated on his unorthodox method of entry, Murphy turned out
empty pockets to denote the absence of money and/or keys to his basement flat
across the Yard. </div>
<br>
<div>
     "I was on me way to meet a woman but it started pissing down, so here I
am. Are you deaf? I knocked on your door until my knuckles were black." He
displayed a chapped fist as evidence.</div>
<br>
<div>
     They repaired to the parlor, beakers brimming. As soon as Murphy crossed
the threshold, he broke into a run. The man's eyes were rolling like the eyes
of the horses of Tintoretto (or even Rosa Bonheur), thought Milo, an aficionado
of the plastic arts.</div>
<br>
<div>
     "I bags the sofa," gasped Murphy, and lost no time in arranging himself in
the attitude of the Strong Man At Ease: supine, feet raised, one arm cushioning
his head, drink squarely planted on midriff. Meanwhile, Milo found himself
occupying the entire space between the two arms of his chair. His bum anchored
his bulk  downwards, while his legs, swelling like engorged goitrefish with the
beer and the wind, buttressed the upper part, being firmly placed side by side
and tapering into feet shod in running shoes of imported Bessarabian oryx
hide <a name="fnB15" href="#fn15">[16]</a>. </div>
<br>
<div>
     There followed a traditional, if somewhat shopworn, scene of Irish
hospitality: without, the throbbing gale; within, the lowering of ale.<a
name="fnB16" href="#fn16">[17]</a> </div>
<br>
<div>
     "That was a rotten day, let me tell you." Murphy received no more than a
coarse slurping sound in reply as Milo applied himself to his fresh drink,
while out of habit gazing over the rim of his glass at the television. Color
faded in and out of the screen image of Tracy/Boone's profile silhouetted
against sunlit mountaintops. A woman wearing a bonnet entered stage left and
flung herself into Boone/Tracy's arms. They embraced, tightly, as Korngold
swelled and credits rolled, then it was back to Cardiff and an update on the
day's rugby (New Zealand 9, Wales 0).       </div>
<br>
<div>
     "What a load of shite," snarled Milo. This was misinterpreted by Murphy as
an overdue response to his complaining about the day's doings and led to a
heated exchange, sadly typical of bachelor friendships <a name="fnB17"
href="#fn17">[18]</a>, before Milo explained himself, his manner mellowing at
the sudden recollection of Murphy's former membership in the All-Ireland
Middleweight Boxing Team. He even sealed his peroration with a smile. Murphy
relaxed, mollified. Still toying with the Rotten Day theme, he lay back again
and gazed at Milo's well-stocked bookshelves, <a name="fnB18"
href="#fn18">[19]</a> although reading for anything other than titillation was
a phenomenon foreign to his tastes; in fact, he hadn't opened a book since the
Easter weekend, when Doreen Grey, a girl he went out with now and then, loaned
him the latest Michelle Stoane bestseller--<em>Slut</em>, or <em>Chick</em>, or
something along those lines <a name="fnB19" href="#fn19">[20]</a>--but he'd
chucked it after about page 10. Murphy, like most young men, was more
interested in sports, wheeled vehicles, TV glamour, technological gimmickry
and, of course, most of all: GIRLS.   </div>
<br>
<div>
     "They're terrible men for the teasing," he said.</div>
<br>
<div>
     Milo blearily awoke from his contemplation of inner space. <a name="fnB20"
href="#fn20">[21]</a></div>
<br>
<div>
     "Who?"</div>
<br>
<div>
     "The girls, of course. Take that Doreen creature, now--you know the one
I'm talking about, a right flirt so she is, works down at Woolworths?"</div>
<br>
<div>
     "That's the one you're on your way to see, is it?"</div>
<br>
<div>
     "No, not that one. Doreen. Ah, come on, you know the girl," coaxed Murphy.
"Reddish hair, or is it brownish-red, or brown altogether, or almost black,
would you say&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp."</div>
<br>
<div>
     "I'd not know her from Eve. When was the last time I went into Woolworths,
for God's sake," spluttered Milo. He was rocking back and forth in an effort to
dislodge himself from the armchair and extinguish a cadaverous television face
lecturing him in Welsh. <a name="fnB21" href="#fn21">[22]</a> Beer spillage was
considerable, impregnating his shirtfront with a tart aroma. Finally, after
seesawing violently five or six times, Milo put down his drink, took a firm
hold of the armrests and--with a mumbled "one-two-heave"--he propelled himself
forward at a sufficient velocity to change channels, switch off the light and
slam the door shut, all without the use of his hands.  </div>
<br>
<div>
     "There." He looked around the room, a smile crumpling his whey-white face.
"That's better." The shadows danced on the wall in the gas fire's cheery glow
as, contrapuntally, the cheerless wind keened through the chinks. "Sure that's
very nice. It is that."</div>
<br>
<div>
     "Turn on the feckin' lights," said Murphy, stridently.</div>
<br>
<div>
     Milo obeyed, but as he did so, he muttered imprecations sotto voce having
to do with Murphy's lineage and general morals. If his friend heard, he gave no
sign; instead, a sloppy grin spread across his face and his eyelids slowly
drooped. Light tenor snoring announced sleep. This suited Milo. He thought
Murphy was a grand old hoor, but a man needed a moment or two to himself now
and then to reflect on things, just. Milo's morale was at low ebb, anyway, what
with the job, the weather, thwarted ambitions, the rent, enforced chastity
(leading, sadly but inexorably, to onanism), etc.--of course, with this last item,
we find ourselves on the familiar, dangerous
ground so well-trodden by blue-jowled clerics and Mother Church on one side and
Austro-American psychoanalysts and the Hollywood crowd on the other: sex, in a
word, always a guaranteed ticket to the shakes. Milo's experience of the matter
was short but broad, somewhat like his person. In his final year at Trinity,
still as virginal as any seminarian, he'd met a honey-skinned Frenchwoman named
Martine, an encounter that led, in panting single file, to your standard
tongue-tied, red-faced, knock-kneed wanker's courtship--oddly successful,
perhaps owing to Martine's being from the great and sophisticated city of
Lyon. <a name="fnB22" href="#fn22">[23]</a> In urban France, that kind of thing
is generally over and done with by age ten, or twelve at the latest, so to see
it in full bloom in an allegedly full-grown man of twenty-three was no doubt
such a novelty to the woman that she gave in just for the laugh that was in it.
Anyhow, the affair lasted for the balance of Milo's undergraduate career, and
pretty well scuttled his degree: come June, there he was in the exam hall,
facing the European History final, <a name="fnB23" href="#fn23">[24]</a> with
any real chance of passing it well behind him. Only Martine existed in Milo's
mind, and she'd gone back to Lyon, unresponsive to his moist missives and
telephonic pleading. Eventually, marriage claimed her, followed boringly by
maturity and maternity and the creeping dowdiness of domestic life. Meanwhile,
Milo, short one degree (B.A., no honours), found fewer and fewer opportunities
for his unlicensed genius. After a year in London pulling pints for the Kilburn
crowd, and six months' illegal building work in New York, rooming with a crazed
Brit-hating rebel from the County Queens, he drifted back to Ireland like ash
on the wind and softly fell to earth in the cozy confines of Spudorgan Hall,
"the Ritz of the Southeast." There were unfriendlier places to be, and he'd had
a worse time of it in New York, but on the loneliest nights the memory of
Martine returned and no time was worse than poor Milo's present, <a name="fnB24"
href="#fn24">[25]</a> and if he was behind with the rent into the bargain, life
was hardly worth the effort. At two hundred and fifty punts a month, the rent
bit hard into his waiter's wages, so hard that sometimes (as now) he was forced
to reconnoitre every streetcorner before venturing round it, lest his landlord,
Tom "The Greek" Maher, loom into view. Outwardly bluff and jovial, given to
affecting Aran sweaters and a Donegal tweed cap, The Greek, paradoxically,
struck Milo as the most diabolical man he had ever met. <a name="fnB25"
href="#fn25">[26]</a> In his eyes--blue as speedwell, with flecks of feral
yellow--there twinkled the spirit of Himmler and de Sade, or so Milo claimed,
perhaps fancifully; certain it was that inexplicable things tended to happen
when The Greek's tenants lagged in the payment of their rent. On each of the
past four days, for instance, Milo had spoken to telephonic whisperers
variously claiming to be a Church of Ireland minister, a travel agent named
Bob, the R.C. Bishop of Monaghan and finally--ominously--a Russian tourist with
a message from "The Big Guy." As if all this weren't enough to drive the sanest
of men to the very brink of madness, on the following Monday, ten days into
arrears, Milo was settling down to watch the repeat of <cite>Strumpet City</cite> on
RTE 2 when a stench as of the overworn underwear of an entire boarding school
rose from beneath the floorboards and rapidly permeated the bungalow. Driven
from his home, Milo made for Mad Molloy's, there to while away the evening
making loud noises of protest over a series of whiskies paid for by none other
than The Greek Maher. The same Greek sat next to him the whole time he was
there, murmuring age-old clich&eacute;s of sympathy: "now, now"; "there,
there"; "I never"; "ya ballocks", etc., accompanied by nudges in the ribcage
and, once, a mock left hook to the jaw fuelled by gusts of laughter and
resonant slaps on the back. Never once during the entire evening did the man
take off his Donegal cap, or pronounce the word <em>rent</em>. This  confirmed
Milo's fears. He spent the rest of the night behind the reception desk at
Spudorgan Hall, only returning to his bungalow in the early morning. The smell
was gone, but on the front doorstep was the decomposing body of a mongrel dog
known to all of Oxtail Yard as the agent of many a sleepless night when the
rutting season was on. <a name="fnB26" href="#fn26">[27]</a> </div>
<br>
<div>
     An especially discordant note in the storm's diminishing song jolted Milo
back to so-called reality.</div>
<br>
<div>
     "It's true that the mysteries of life are deep and various," he said to
himself, staring at his own face staring back from the now-blank television
screen, "but that one took the grand piano."      </div>
<br>
<div>
     And so to bed, not including three visits to the jakes and one to the
front door (exit Murphy, groggily).</div>

<a name="fn13" href="#fnB13">[14]</a> As Milo wrote in his diary: <em>Prodigious
and giant-like is Milo's stove, boasting six coal-black burners, four in back,
two in front, each wide enough to service a pot of porridge for six, and they
with the hunger of unfed men; deep as the pockets of Dail Eireann its oven, and
broader than the broad sands of Magilligan strand; higher and loftier its bulk
than the golden-stoned majesty of Joyce Castle, dominion of the Ondt and
industrious Gracehoper; louder roar the six flames of its burners than the
massed throats of the warriors of Meath, and they without drink taken this
fortnight past; sweeter sings the gas through its nozzle of brass than the
purling of the tern in the soughing reeds of Inishboffin; heartier than burly
pub-crawlers the soups and stews fermented there, and ranker than the summer
sweat of panting lovers the lingering aftertaste thereof; smooth as Chinese
silk the porcelain hull, and of a sheen brighter than Lough Neagh in the gilt

<a name="fn15" href="#fnB15">[16]</a> Will you get out of that right now! With
oryx hide loafers going for fifty quid the pair at Boylans? And your man

Synge, or another of the Holy Ireland crowd, the ones you'd find lurking in the
cool Celtic twilight and forever peopling the place with silver-tongued hags
and toadstool-dwellers and harpists with arse-length hair; to hell with that
lot, the Clurichauns are the men to look out for (have you checked your cellar
lately?)! <a href="#fnB16">[back]</a></div>

All right, if you insist. Here's a random sample: <cite>Encyclopedia of Irish Farm
Animals</cite> (G. Nackert, Cork, 1965); <cite>Mother Arafat's Arab Kitchen</cite>
(Redgrave House, 1980); <cite>Freight Trains of Canada</cite> (C.N. Rail, Winnipeg,
1949); <cite>&iexcl;Nalgas! 101 Rear Views of Cuban Women in Swimsuits</cite>
(Anon., Miami, 1989); <cite>Fifty Pee a Pint: The Later Verse of Jasper
Hoolihan</cite> (O'Duffy Press, Athlone, 1980<cite>); Two Bob a Pint: The Complete
Early Poems of Jasper Hoolihan</cite> (Blueshirt Press, Athlone, 1966); <cite>Four
Great Irish Recipes</cite> (Stubble House, Sligo, 1982), etc. The remainder of
Milo's collection consists mostly of collections of verse--many of them by the
aforementioned Hoolihan--and a few classics (Scott, Dante, Kavanagh, etc.)
guiltily nicked from Fred Hanna's in Dublin in college days gone by: an
unambitious display, and yet! Somewhere deep inside Milo Rogers there squirms a
nascent bookworm (or is it tape-?)! <a href="#fnB18">[back]</a></div>
<br>
<div>
<a name="fn19" href="#fnB19">[20]</a> <cite>Wench</cite>, actually, #1 on the
<cite>Sunday Post</cite> best-seller list for 37 weeks. Ms. Stoane's latest
blockbuster is the story of Tess, unwanted illegitimate daughter of the Duke of
Whipminster. Raised by Rosie, the head chambermaid--who later dies of
tuberculosis in an alleyway as the German panzers roll into Paris--Tess
discovers her true identity in the brutal arms of Thatcher, the wine steward.
Determined to claim her rightful inheritance, she fights and claws her way from
the low groggeries of Cheapside and the belowstairs brothels of Houndsditch to
the salons of Mayfair, the Left Bank and Monte Carlo, until finally--as the
German panzers roll into Paris--she acquires the rank and title she has so long
sought; but her happiness is short-lived. Soon afterwards, she loses her
polo-playing Argentinian fianc&eacute; Apollo Belvedere in a freak horse
collision at Auteuil; two days later, lesbian fashionplate and would-be suitor
Caca Chamois, jilted by Tess, commits suicide with an elegant silver-plated
handgun in the Bois de Boulogne as the German panzers roll into Paris.
Disguised as an oberst in the Wehrmacht, Tess flees to Hollywood, where she
meets and marries aging Dutch-born matinee idol Joop den Uyl. <a href="#fnB19">[back]</a></div>

<a name="fn21" href="#fnB21">[22]</a> Knowing the men of Harlech as I do, I'd
say it was probably old Dafydd Jones ap Jones, the Non-conformist minister who
gets 3 minutes' free air time every Saturday night just after closing time to
scold the ladies for letting their menfolk relive the pukey heaven of Stag
Night once a week (except in south Powys, and the drier parts of Dyfed). <a href="#fnB21">[back]</a></div>

<div>
<a name="fn22" href="#fnB22">[23]</a> There's the place for us, son, a gracious
town of a million or so--about Dublin-sized, and the air's a bit close in
winter months, so they've their fair share of bronchial hackers and
round-the-clock bottle men, but the grub's in a different class altogether. The
only Liffeyside eatery that comes close is Le Phacoch&egrave;re in Harold's
Cross, and guess who runs it? You're right: a man from Lyon (Jean-Claude)!
Seriously, now, what I can't understand is how the locals can take the pace--
you know, every single blooming day God sends they're off to Bocuse's, or the
Bouton d'Or, or the Tr&egrave;sgros Brothers', or <em>chez</em> Alain Blanc,
shovelling in the <em>cassoulet au vin blanc</em> and the <em>caille aux raisins
noirs</em> and (as if that weren't enough) washing the whole caper down with a
Beaujolais, or a smart palate-tickler from the Rh&ocirc;ne valley!
Civilisation, that's what it is, boy; that, and no mistake. There's nothing
like it for prolonging life. <a href="#fnB22">[back]</a></div>

<a name="fn24" href="#fnB24">[25]</a> Sniff, sniff. Suitable accompaniment

<a name="fn25" href="#fnB25">[26]</a> And he'd met a few, that galoot in New
York, for one: as a staunch fifth generation Irishman, his declared mission in
life was to assassinate the British prime minister. Once, overloaded with
Budweiser, he practised on Milo, using steak knives. Not surprisingly, it was
their last night as room-mates. <a href="#fnB25">[back]</a></div>
<br>
<div>
<a name="fn26" href="#fnB26">[27]</a> God, that reminds me of something I read
in the <cite>Press</cite>, a while back: "The Odorous Overcoat of Sandymount Strand."
That was a story and a half. Wait till I tell you. James Barnacle, solicitor's
clerk and aspiring playwright--i.e., a perfectly respectable class of
person--found himself being overcome by fumes every morning as he put on his
old Burberry mac. In chronological order, your man slid heavily to the floor
after a) kissing the wife b) adjusting his tie in the hallway mirror and c)
reaching for the dreaded coat; then, of course, he needed prompt reviving with
smelling salts and turpentine to be on time for the 7:41 at Sandymount Station,
a terrible drain on the family finances. After several weeks of this, and poor
old Jembo beginning to topple over as if banjaxed at both ends of the day
inclusive--incurring serious risk of concussion, with that raised footrail at
the Parnell Mooney's--Father Joyce, the Television Exorcist, performed a TV
exorcism in the dead of night, hoping to catch the evil visitor napping, so to
speak. Confident in the powers of Good, next morning, regular as one-two-three,
Jembo put on his coat with a light Dublin air on his lips--and whammo, there he
was, measuring his full length at the wife's feet, exorcism or no exorcism.
This can't go on, says the missus (a woman of firm opinions), it's him or me,
I'm off to stay with my sister in Longford. Arrangements were accordingly made,
dress clothes brushed, shoes polished to a high gloss, parcels containing
personal belongings entrusted to the mails--and wouldn't you know it, she
mailed her sister the wrong parcel, containing you-know-what (meanwhile, Jim's
falling fits stopped altogether--very suggestive, if you ask me)! Naturally,
once Sis caught a whiff of it, the coat went straight from her house to the
laundry, but no sooner was the wrapping paper off than the laundry crew passed
out as promptly as if they'd been bashed on the noodle one at a time with a
blackthorn stick, or billy club. They survived, thanks be to God, and shortly
thereafter the townsfolk torched the Burberry in a traditional Longford
auto-da-f&eacute;, so we'll never know the whole truth; but, haunted or not,
that old mac was a godsend to Jim, if you want my opinion. Last we heard, his
play <cite>The Haunted Overcoat</cite> was in its forty-fourth week of rehearsals at
the Peacock Theatre (or was it the Abbey?). <a href="#fnB26">[back]</a>
