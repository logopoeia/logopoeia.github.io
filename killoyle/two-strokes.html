      The worst students were the best ones, as the teacher's saying
      had it. By that definition, Hockenburg, the tall German with
      the skin problem, was the worst of the lot. Being German, he
      was the only student who never forgot his homework, or missed a
      class, or arrived late--never, in fact, did anything that might
      betray ordinary human weakness. His critical faculties were
      especially acute at half-eight on Monday mornings, when he
      arrived as punctually as the Munich-Hamburg express, frowning
      in disapproval at Myles's bottomless yawns and dishevelled
      morning face. In class he hectored loudly and held Myles
      personally responsible for every grammatical conundrum in the
      English language, causing Myles to wonder, idly, what Herr
      Hockenburg <em>père</em> had been up to, fifty or so years
      previously; as a consequence, Myles was looking forward to the
      bank holiday and its promise of not one but three
      Hockenburgless days as feverishly as a prisoner yearns for the
      date of his release.
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      There were other Germans at Interworld Language Academy, along
      with the Japanese, Italians, French, Spaniards, sundry Eastern
      Europeans and Chinese or two who formed a student body one
      hundred and seventy strong. This was down twenty from the year
      before, but Colonel Rainbird, the director, had great hopes for
      the next year, when the global impact would be felt of the
      glossy full-color brochures he'd mailed out to banks and
      businesses from Minsk to Tokyo. Myles was doubtful. Given the
      choice between learning English in Ireland and learning it in
      England, most foreigners would choose England, nine times out
      of ten. Only Interworld's lower prices and its location eight
      miles from the Continental ferry docks at Rosslare kept them
      coming, even if they came with all the usual muddled notions
      about Ireland and the Irish. A school run by the English, in
      England, was, in their minds, first cousin to Oxford and
      Cambridge, and indeed most British language schools, in Myles's
      experience, meretriciously boasted names evocative of dreaming
      spires and medieval quadrangles: Oxwell, Canterbridge,
      Harrowford. A school in Ireland, on the other hand, implied
      mercurial Celtic behavior along bomb-throwing, drunken, and/or
      spontaneous verse-spouting lines, but those who expected to
      find such folkloric scenes in high gear when they arrived were
      soon disappointed. Colonel Rainbird, the director, maintained
      strict discipline and austere standards of behavior for staff
      and students alike. Indeed, it could be said (and often was)
      that the Colonel's eighteen years in the British Army (Royal
      Inniskillings) had drained away the very little Irish he'd been
      born with. Under his firm rule most of the ne'er-do-wells were
      soon weeded out, leaving the Hockenburgs to flourish.
      Interworld Academy, as Myles was wont to observe, combined the
      coziness of the Tower of London with all the career
      opportunities of a Roman galley.
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      It was Friday, the week was dead, long live Bank Holiday. By
      ten past five the staffroom was empty, except for Myles and
      jolly Ben Ryan.
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "Where are you off to this weekend, Myles?" inquired jolly Ben
      with deadly irony, as it was well known that dull Myles never
      went anywhere except Gallogly's Bar on Saturday nights.
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "Oh I don't know. I might pop up to Cork for the book fair."
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "Come out of that, boy." Ben tossed his briefcase into his
      locker. "You know perfectly well you won't stir from the idiot
      box until tomorrow night, then you'll get laggards at
      Gallogly's and spend all day Sunday sleeping it off and all day
      Monday catching up on the Sunday papers."
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      It was a sketch taken from the life as only one who had seen
      Myles Nolan's life at close range could have sketched it, and
      Ben Ryan had spent half his first year at Interworld Academy
      sharing digs with Myles, then in his third year there, and in
      the intervening two years nothing much had changed in Myles's
      fretful bachelorhood; only this weekend there was the faintest
      flicker of long-damped flames.
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "As a matter of fact, Ben, I have no plans to watch the
      television at all," said Myles, dismissing with an airy wave
      the very idea of telly. "I was considering making a call on a
      young lady."
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "Were you now. Jesus, steady on, Myles. Do I know the lovely
      colleen at all?"
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "You might. And then again you might not."
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "Cagey, aren't we? Fair enough. A man's entitled to his little
      secrets. I've one of my own in Dublin and I don't want to keep
      her waiting. Good luck, old Myles."
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "Cheers, Ben."
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      And Ben was gone to his car, a sports model that would
      transport him at high speed through the October dusk to the one
      million inhabitants and sexy secrets of the Hibernian
      metropolis. Myles finished his cigarette and flicked the end
      into the silently crumbling peat fire. It was God's own truth,
      he was considering making a call on a young lady, but there was
      no doubt about Ben's knowing her. She, too, endured the
      tortured vowels and verbal horrors of Hockenburg and his kind,
      and Ben would probably laugh if he knew. The lady was Clare
      Machen, their own course supervisor--Mac Hen, Ben called her,
      quite unfairly in Myles's opinion. Clare was a clever girl:
      honors degree from UCD, two poems published in <cite>The Irish
      Press</cite>. Clever, and not at all hard on the eyes, in fact
      (Myles thought) she had at least as good a figure as that
      Spanish bint in Intermediate Two Ben was always slobbering
      over. She was unmarried, like Myles, and like Myles she lived
      in a bungalow on The Parade, ten minutes' brisk walk from the
      Academy and about the same distance from Myles. As colleagues,
      however, they inhabited different worlds. Clare gave Myles
      instructions and Myles carried them out in his languid way; yet
      there was no male-female opposition between them because Myles
      Nolan was deeply indifferent to that kind of thing--as well as
      being, as Ben and others were kind enough to say from time to
      time, a Decent Fellow Altogether. Clare herself had also said
      something similar only a week before, and Myles derived hope
      from this; hope, and determination. The time for collaring a
      woman was at hand. The single life had its points--freedom to
      dream, freedom to come and go at odd hours, freedom to get
      rotten fluttery-eyed drunk--but he was thirty-nine, and there
      was a long celibate funk ahead if he didn't abandon the snug
      sameness of television, Gallogly's Bar and the Sunday papers
      for at least one more gallop into the arena. Once before, in
      his more energetic early thirties, he'd mounted his charger and
      entered the lists, but combat had suddenly been called off when
      a Lancelot named (he'd never forget) Steve Jablonski--ex-U.S.
      Marine, ex-seminarian--took over the defense of the young
      woman's virtue by robbing her of it. Consequently, the district
      of South Dublin where she lived, between Milltown and Windy
      Arbour, was forever Jablonskied; in fact, whenever America, or
      Americans, were mentioned, Myles first saw that suburban
      stretch of Dublin, fleetingly, in his mind's eye, just as a
      certain row of bungalows along The Parade popped into mental
      view at the thought of the upcoming Bank Holiday Weekend...
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      Footsteps marching down the corridor at a martial pace tore
      Myles away from the old days. Colonel Rainbird was conducting a
      final tour of inspection before going home. On his bald head
      sat a Donegal tweed cap, his nightly off-duty signal.
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "Still hanging about, Nolan?" he inquired, rhetorically.
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "Yes, sir. I can't seem to get going." Myles stiffened slightly
      to attention, despite himself.
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "Bloody Germans want me to drive 'em to Cork for some music
      festival or other," grumbled the Colonel. "Said yes just to get
      'em out of the way for the weekend. Can't have the Boche
      belting out old favourites in the local hostelries, can we?
      Might dry up our credit for good."
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "Credit's always important," suggested Myles.
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "Right you are. Never more so than when you operate on a
      shoestring, as we do. Well, I'm off. Fancy a lift down to the
      town? I've got the old bus outside."
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "No thanks, sir. I'll walk. It's a nice quiet sort of evening."
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "Will be when Jerry's safely on his way. Half eight on Tuesday,
      then?"
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "Half eight it is, sir."
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      The Colonel departed, on his way to confront the old enemy.
      Hockenburg, Myles was sure, would be the group leader, or <em>
      gruppenführer</em>, of the Cork expedition, or offensive. He
      imagined them arms linked, roaring <cite>Die Wacht am</cite>
      <cite>Rhein</cite> in some half-timbered rural inn; then he
      chided himself for indulging in the kind of one-dimensional
      stereotype he disliked so much when it was applied to his own
      compatriots.
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      Still, there was some truth in all stereotypes, including the
      ones about Ireland. You just had to go beyond them, even if
      sometimes they seemed dead on the ball. As with Germans.
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      The streetlights along Toole Street, which meandered downhill
      from the Academy to the town, were already lit and twinkled
      mistily through the trees. Small groups of students, clustered
      together according to nationality, were standing at the gates,
      all abandoning English in the urgency of deciding where to go
      and how to get there. Myles reckoned the French and Italians
      would head for Dublin, or even London, and two or three would
      find better things to do than return to Interworld Academy on
      Tuesday morning. As for the Japanese, they would undoubtedly
      flock southward to County Kerry and the Dingle peninsula,
      having been instructed to do so before leaving Japan, and in a
      week or two Myles and his colleagues would be have to sit
      through a slide show depicting beaming Japanese faces against
      the mournful backdrop of Kerry. Actually--and this was
      unexpected, at least to Myles (one stereotype up the
      spout)--the Japanese were riotous pubcrawlers. Four of the
      town's fourteen pubs were on permanent Japanese alert, not
      enforcing an all-out ban--the consensus among publicans being
      that the almighty Yen spoke louder than the odd broken
      windowpane--but stopping short of actually hanging out the
      Rising Sun in welcome.
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      Myles directed a general wave to all on his way out, ignored by
      all except Mr. Watanabe from Intermediate Two, who never did
      his homework and who waved back, wildly, with both hands.
    </div>
    <br />
    <br />

    <div>
      * * * * *
    </div>
    <br />
    <br />

    <div>
      Myles lived in a plain one-level house of the type known in
      seaside towns as a bungalow, with the word's lingering
      nostalgia for horizons on which the sun never set. It was at
      the bottom end of The Parade and commanded a view, through the
      stone crosses of St. Colm's churchyard, of the water and, in
      fine weather, of the white sails of the leisure class. In
      autumn and winter, with the leisure class slaloming down Alpine
      slopes or cresting the Aegean waves, only the Havre and
      Fishguard ferries out of Rosslare Harbour interrupted the solid
      blue line of the sea. Most days Myles took his breakfast at a
      spindly table facing the window in his parlor, and when the sun
      was out it was a fine sight, blue on blue, with a pinkish mist
      in the distance that might have risen from Bahamian atolls--the
      Maldives--Tahiti--<em>far Tortuga itself!</em>--but only came
      from Wales.
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      On Saturday morning Myles, breakfasting early, stared out to
      sea and devised insinuating phrases to capture the heart of
      Clare Machen, or at least to gain admittance to her bungalow.
      Myles belonged to the courtly and timid ranks of bachelors who,
      when encouraged, cling like limpets, but who otherwise--if
      ignored or rebuffed or opposed by forces of Jablonski
      strength--simply watch and dream from a distance. This watching
      and distant dreaming went well beyond mere longing for
      tempest-tossed romance. In all that he did Myles was removed,
      yet not indifferent; like an artist or scientist, he watched
      and deduced, but being neither artist nor scientist his
      deductions led no further than his dreams. His students
      sometimes caught him gazing slack-jawed, as in shock, at the
      portrait of Jonathan Swift that hung above the door in
      Intermediate Two, but it was no sudden amazement at the sight
      of the dotty old Dean that brought on the vacant stare. It was
      a meandering process of thought that might originate in the
      third or fourth repetition of the Past Perfect Tense (<em>"Maï
      dogue ad hallready beeten ze postman wan Haï harrived"</em>),
      then bounce off the walls past the narrow view of the car park
      through the half-shuttered windows up to the ceiling and
      finally come to rest on the bug-eyed Dean, whose image would
      summon up memories of Dublin--the Liberties--the good old
      eighteenth century when men were more or less men--other
      memories, mostly fabricated--visions of periwigged Myles amid
      admiring ladies of Gainsborough splendour...then someone, not
      infrequently Hockenburg, would irritably recall him to the drab
      reality of Intermediate Two.
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      English grammar was too small a stage for Myles's ambitions,
      but ambition and energy were mismatched in his indolent soul.
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      He went for a walk that Saturday, as he did every Saturday. but
      instead of heading directly to the quayside, as he usually did,
      he took a detour up the Parade past Clare Machen's house, in
      the feeble hope that Coincidence might step in and arrange a
      meeting ("Clare! How are you! Listen! Do you think we
      might...?"), but no such meeting occurred, although he could
      easily have forced one by marching up her front path and
      ringing the doorbell. He did nothing of the kind; in fact, he
      was beginning to wonder if all this carryon was worth the faint
      but persistent discomfort in his intestines he had been feeling
      since Bank Holiday weekend began. There was an all-or-nothing
      quality about gambling on a woman's goodwill that suited a more
      desperate personality than Myles. A rebuff, even a gentle one,
      would tip the balance of their friendship, and the ensuing
      gossip might capsize it altogether. Myles dreaded the evil
      nibbling of gossip. Silly fellow that he was, the worst anyone
      could say was that he drank himself sillier during the long
      quiet hours; rebuffed, he would stand as a monument of failure,
      even a laughingstock. Better err on the side of caution,
      cautious Myles advised himself.
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      Others, mostly from Dublin, discovered the southeast coast on
      long weekends, and they and their children filled the streets,
      eating fried cod and chips from newspaper cones, wrangling in
      loud city voices about the quality of Co. Wexford fried cod and
      chips compared to the Dublin variety, taking pictures of one
      another posed against piers and blue water that might have been
      anywhere from there to Teneriffe, and generally upsetting the
      civic order for its own good, because without the big city
      money the place would soon sink into provincial torpor. Myles
      quite enjoyed the tourists, with their reminder of bustle and
      the urban life that sometimes seemed as remote as the places
      his students came from. Like Mr. Watanabe of Osaka, who was
      lounging outside Donovan's Bar on the corner of The Parade and
      Collins Street, hands in pockets, head cocked jauntily to one
      side. Myles was reminded of a photograph of James Joyce and
      wondered where the young J.J. would have exiled himself, had he
      been Japanese: Shanghai? Honolulu? Probably Paris.
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "Good afternoon, Mr. Watanabe," said Myles, drawing near.
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "Oh," gasped Mr. Watanabe. "Hi, teacher." He grinned. "Top of
      afternoon to you, ha?" His grin lingered, sloppily, hinting at
      drink already taken.
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "Why aren't you away to Killarney with the rest of them?" asked
      Myles.
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      Watanabe beamed in pleasure. "Most Japanese are sheep. One
      goes, everyone go. Goes. I try to be different. If Japanese
      people, they stayed here for weekend, I ood go to Kil-lar-ney.
      But there's too many Japanese people here. I don't come here to
      see other Japanese people. I come, came, have come? To have
      fun. Learn English. Drink Irish beer!" He finished in a
      near-shout. Passersby turned their heads to look at the noisy
      Asian and his Irish companion. Whom he now invited across the
      threshold of Donovan's Bar to share a drink. Myles accepted
      with some reluctance, it being only half-two in the afternoon
      under a booming blue sky that spoke of other things than
      tippling; but Mr. Watanabe had been among Irishmen long enough
      to learn that few of them refused a drink if others were
      paying. They went in together.
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "You again," said the barman.
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "Oh! Hello, Tim," said Mr. Watanabe. "This is Professor Myles."
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "Aha. Now you listen to me," said Tim, lowering his voice and
      leaning forward on the bar. "I don't want none of them dirty
      songs again, never mind if the owld whores in here think it's
      good crack."
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "I am sorry, Tim. In Japan we'll go to Karaoke bar to drink and
      sing. When you come to Osaka I take you to best Karaoke bar and
      you can sing Irish songs."
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "Fair enough," said Tim. "When I come to Japan we'll go on the
      tear. But as long as you're here, I'm warnin' yez now, we'll
      have the guards in the place if you start up with them songs
      again."
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "I will not sing," said Mr. Watanabe, sternly.
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "Good man. What'll it be, then?"
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "Two pints of stout," said Mr. Watanabe. "And a double Bush."
    </div>
    <br />

      Doubles and pints were mother's milk to Mr. Watanabe. Fierce in
      his intentions, he devoted himself single-mindedly to the task
      and tolerated no shirking. Myles was in danger of finding
      himself outclassed. Watanabe's technique was first to swallow
      the head off his pint, then empty his double whiskey into the
      beer and finish off the mixture in two or three gigantic gulps.
      It was an untutored, even crude, method of drinking, but an
      effective one. After three of these cocktails Watanabe was
      crimson-faced but still going strong. Myles called on deep
      ancestral reserves to meet the challenge and by the time the
      regulars started to arrive in the bar, around five, his tally
      was one double Bushmills behind Watanabe. Together they
      totalled an even dozen. Myles was fever-hot and soaring into
      wide yellow-gold skies somewhere east of Mandalay.
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "I swear to God, Mr. Watanabe," he began, but he was cut off by
      an upraised hand.
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "No, no," said Watanabe. "Too formal. We drink together all
      day. My name is Takayoshi, but you can call me Taka."
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "Grand, Taka. As I was saying, I swear to God bloomin' almighty
      that one of these days I'll go to Japan. I'll get out of this
      bloody jacks of a town somehow. Get on an airplane and get off
      in Japan. I swear before God and all the massed saints of
      Ireland."
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "Japan is most beautiful in May."
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "Ah. Right. Cherry blossom time and all that carry-on, is it?"
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "Not just cherry blossom. Also Sake festival. And you know,
      Myles, it is much better pay in Japan for English teacher. In
      Japan student has respect for teacher."
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "No bloody respect here, that's certain. You're right, Taka.
      I'm for the Land of the Rising Sun. Slainte."
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "Good luck."
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      Watanabe swallowed the last of his six doubles and rose to his
      feet, which he briefly scrutinized, before clearing his throat
      eloquently; then, to Myles's horror, he started to sing,
      approximately.
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "Oh Babs the Babe she was a wench
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      Who liked the sound of love--huh!
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      Who liked the sound of love, oh yeah."
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      The stolid Irish citizenry at the bar, taken by surprise,
      suddenly fell silent, pints halfway to lips, mouths agape.
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "And when she kiss," wailed Mr. Watanabe, "she kiss so good,
      oh! IKNOW I'M GONNA DIE, OH YEAH."
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "Come along, there, Taka, we don't want to be chucked out now.
      Sit down, for Christ's sake," muttered Myles, but the muse, or
      muses, had triumphed. Taka was in full swing, ceremoniously
      Asian, bawdily Caucasian, swaying from side to side, eyes
      closed.
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "So WHOOP go her booty feet, up into the hay!
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      And WHOOP go her pretty bum, up into the air!"
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "Right," shouted Tim the barman. "Can't say I didn't warn yez.
      Go sing yer Chinese love songs somewhere else and don't come
      back."
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      Watanabe stopped singing and opened his eyes. The drinking had
      resumed at the bar, but the drinkers were watching him
      uneasily, a sidelong scrutiny by Irish natives of this
      unexpected Asiatic gentleman.
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "I am not fucking Chinese," said Watanabe, slowly and
      distinctly. "I want apology, please."
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "Apology me arse. Out with the pair of yez or I call the
      guards."
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "No. Apology or I will break everything."
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "Right," said Tim. "Hang on there, lads. I'll be back when I've
      taken care of the Yellow Peril." A pint glass whizzed through
      the air and exploded into shards on the opposite wall. "Mother
      of God what was that. You bloody Buddhist. I'll set yez right,
      so I will."
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      The donnybrook that followed was vigorous and, for Myles, an
      exhilarating glimpse of the sporting life. Two of the sturdier
      men at the bar joined in the Home Team, with Myles on the side
      of the Visitors. Watanabe scored bulls' eyes on the dartboard
      with two of his pint glasses and narrowly missed Tim's bald
      head with a third, followed by an ashtray and a whiskey glass
      that smashed into the mirror behind the bar, creating a zigzag
      pattern of cracks Cubist or Dadaist in concept. Myles, punched
      once in the eye, punched back and felled an ugly masher twice
      his size, then he and Watanabe threw up a barricade of
      overturned tables and battled their way laterally to the door,
      pressed every inch of the way by Tim and his bruisers. The
      noncombatant audience at the bar clapped and cheered when,
      finally, the Nippo-Hibernian fighting unit was pushed out into
      the street and almost into the arms of the Gardai. Three
      uniformed members of that body were hurrying up as Myles and
      Taka tumbled out, but, drunk as they were, they still had the
      presence of mind to split up and head off in opposite
      directions to confuse the enemy. Myles half ran, half staggered
      down Collins Street to The Parade and relaxed his pace in the
      early evening throng of tourists. God, he said to himself, that
      was a grand old barney, so it was, and what I need now is a
      drink.
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      On his way in search of additional, redundant alcohol--deciding
      on a quieter venue, maybe The Quare Fellow on the Wexford
      Road--his previously longed-for Coincidence quietly intervened
      and he saw Clare Machen, carrying two shopping bags, crossing
      over from the supermarket at Toole Street. The ordinary weekday
      Myles Nolan would have frozen in his tracks and probably run
      away, but at six o'clock on that glorious Saturday
      evening--with the sun dipping behind the looming fortress of
      Interworld Academy on the hill and a sheen on the sea all the
      way to Wales--Myles was more than his ordinary self. He was
      fueled by six pints of stout and three doubles and cherry
      blossom time in old Honshu. As Clare approached, it was a merry
      Myles who greeted her with a kiss on both cheeks as,
      tut-tutting, he snatched the shopping bags from her hands.
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "Now, you're not about to carry them huge bloody things up the
      hill," he said. "Not when you've me at your side to do the
      heavy work."
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "Thank you, Myles," she said. Myles was smiling fixedly, like a
      politician courting votes. Clare, arms folded, gave him a long
      once-over.
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "You've been in the pubs," she said. He nodded, still smiling.
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "You're flewtered," she said, decisively. He laughed.
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "Not at all, girl. Just in good fighting trim." They walked
      along together. Myles was carrying both shopping bags in one
      hand, as if to demonstrate immense strength.
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "You know Watanabe in Intermediate Two?" he asked. "The fellow
      who does damn-all?"
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "Oh yes. The notorious Mr. Watanabe."
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "Well, the notorious Mr. W. and I are after getting ourselves
      turfed out of Donovan's Bar because all of a sudden your man
      gets to his feet and starts bawling about Merry Molly's bum,
      bringing down the wrath of the management on our heads and
      exposing, I'm afraid to say, the ugly face of Irish racism. Oh
      it's a fine tolerant race we are when there's nothing but other
      Irish faces around, but bring on a Jap and by Christ we're no
      better than hand-me-down Brits." Smiling no longer, Myles was
      uplifted by righteous anger. "That bugger behind the bar called
      him a Chinaman, and do you know what Watanabe said?"
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "No, what did he say?" Clare, aglow with sympathetic
      indignation.
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "He said, 'I am not fucking Chinese'."
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "That must have put them in their place."
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "True enough. Well, not entirely. They threw us out. But it
      just goes to show, eh? You don't want to go about messing with
      the Japanese."
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      They walked on to Clare's bungalow, named Villa Bella Vista by
      its previous owners, ardent gardeners and lovers of gnomes, six
      of which still peopled the flowered lawn behind the house; as a
      former member of the UCD Republican Women's Drama Collective
      (Official Wing), Clare--with a fine sense of
      republican-collectivist drama--had painted the gnomes' caps the
      colors of the Tricolour, so that the six small heads formed two
      rows of green, white and gold on either side of the garden
      path. Myles had never seen the garden and expressed his
      admiration for Clare's inventive touch when, after depositing
      the groceries in the kitchen, they went on a tour of the
      property. Along the pathway the gnomes' heads spelled out the
      banner of the Republic, down to the stand of trees that
      shivered red and yellow in the evening light. Beyond the
      neighboring houses on the slope below the sea stretched wide;
      from across the sea, like Myles's students, came the night.
      Ships' lights on the horizon punctuated the approaching
      darkness. This view, which had become so familiar to Myles,
      seemed suddenly unusually significant, as if there were meaning
      in the ships' lights (lost souls? beacons of hope?) and the
      darkening sky (disease? despair?), or was it, he wondered, only
      the drink and the startling fact of having eased himself past
      the barricade of small talk into conversation with Clare and,
      no less amazingly, into her house?
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "Would you like a drink?"
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "Clare, I thought you'd never ask."
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      Clare produced whiskey and they sat by the fireplace in facing
      armchairs. To Clare, Myles was the odd one. Whether he was a
      marginal case or just an introvert she didn't know, nor could
      she decide if his seemingly disconnected remarks denoted wit or
      idiocy. At the Academy they occasionally had social evenings
      lubricated with Babycham and ginger ale--except for the
      Colonel, who sipped discreetly from a flask and disappeared
      early on--but when Myles attended these functions, which he did
      rarely, he sat alone in a corner unless called upon to make
      introductions or propose a toast, duties he abhorred and
      performed in a wandering monotone. What was worse, he never
      seemed to go anywhere. Clare, who from her college days had
      been socially inclined, wondered what bachelor neuroses
      tormented him, and her wondering was the next thing to
      interest, the way women warily circumnavigate eccentric
      solitary men. Once, Myles had walked her home after class, and
      instead of talking about himself, or gossiping about the
      students or the other teachers, he went on without a pause
      about the matriarchal element in ancient Irish culture and, on
      parting, urged her to read Graves's <cite>The White
      Goddess</cite>. If she did (he said), she would understand
      herself better as a woman! Raving twaddle, she thought, and
      imagined Myles alone at night muttering to himself over books
      written by other muttering nutters. Yet here he was, at ease in
      her best armchair with a whiskey in one hand and an elegantly
      gesticulating cigarette in the other, telling her the story of
      his life, unrehearsed: the brief years of undergraduate glory
      (double-first, Dean's Prize in history); the Jablonski crisis;
      the journeys to Paris, Rome and Vienna; the long years at
      Interworld Academy; the (unspoken but implied) long decline.
      Then another whiskey.
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "Sorry to be gassing on about myself like this," he said,
      unapologetically. She watched him as he poured himself the
      whiskey. Through the brazen facade of the drinker she saw acute
      self-consciousness in the sudden twitching of his eyebrows and
      the overplayed flourish in his wrist when he offered her the
      bottle. Ah, he's remembered, she thought. He's remembered he's
      alone with me in my house and he hasn't a notion how to
      proceed. For a moment, she yielded to the female luxury of
      witnessing the eager male at a loss, but she was a humane woman
      with many years behind her of caring about the wretched of the
      earth. She took pity on Myles, as did he on her. In the shadows
      of the fireplace, with the slow lights of distant ships on the
      night horizon, they talked more easily than before of their
      histories and desires. It was a joining of solitudes. Nolan,
      you eejit, said Myles to himself, the woman's a treasure. And
      Clare was surprised at how natural it seemed, to sit and talk
      with mad Myles Nolan.
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      At last he said good night and went home. Not so long before he
      would have made a haimes of it by lunging, whiskey-odorous, for
      her cleavage, but he was wise enough to know that harmony had
      been struck that night, and drooling advances would only have
      jarred it into dissonance. Harmoniously, Myles sang all the way
      home, like a merry farmhand. In his gut there blossomed a
      warmth greater than the warmth of mere whiskey as he wove his
      homeward way, describing figure eights and wild whorls on the
      pavement, acting for himself and the lightships on the horizon
      the part of debonair Myles Astaire, his Ginger Clare a hop skip
      and <em>jetée</em> up the old Parade. Out at sea a foghorn
      mooed, like a cow calving. The lights of the town below
      glistened like dewdrops in the damp air, and on the heights
      above the Academy loomed like Schloss Frankenstein, dark but
      for the lighted rectangle of the Colonel's window in the east
      wing.

      The Colonel was sitting at his desk, looking at photographs.
      Next to him on the desk was an almost-empty bottle of whiskey.
      He was loudly humming an old regimental marching song. If
      anyone had been within earshot, he or she might have detected a
      quavering in the upper registers. If that hypothetical listener
      had also become a spectator, he or she might have noticed a
      slight tremor in the bony hands that had at one time or another
      held every firearm in the Royal Inniskillings arsenal and that
      now held glossy snapshots of romping teenaged girls in
      mock-uniform.
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      The Colonel sang.
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "Oh the soldiers of the King we are,
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      And stand we shall
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      Or die we must
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      Oh bom-bom-bom
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      Ta bom-tee-dom-dom."
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      In the photographs the girls frolicked on the grass, played
      hopscotch, tumbled down slides, all the while displaying
      milkfed bodies under their skimpy uniforms. Colonel and Mrs.
      Rainbird were childless and had long since called off all
      efforts to remedy the situation. The Colonel never really knew
      what to do in the first place, said his wife, because it wasn't
      part of Officer's Training at Sandhurst. As for Caroline, the
      Colonel's private opinion was that she was about as titillating
      in the nude as a hundredweight of turnips. It was only
      twenty-eight years of habit--and Caroline's quite exceptional
      Tandoori chicken--that kept them together. On Saturdays, when
      Caroline had her bridge night at the McIlwaines,' the Colonel
      returned to the school after dinner and walked the empty halls
      like the ghost of Elsinore until it was time to settle down in
      the office with a bottle and the latest unmarked envelope from
      Teenscape studios. There was desperation in it, but also (our
      imaginary onlooker might say) a kind of dignity, as if the
      Colonel had defiantly retreated into the deepest foxhole on the
      battlefield, taking with him the barest essentials of life.
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "And far from Albion's shore
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      King and Crown gone to war
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>

    <div>
      He refilled his glass and drank. Cyprus came to mind: his last
      tour of duty, hunting down those EOKA bastards who went about
      shooting everybody to advance their cause. Like that shower up
      North, calling themselves Irishmen. He was as much an Irishman
      as they were, so he was, but he'd done his bit for Britain too,
      and if there was any sense left in these Godforsaken islands
      they'd get together again under the Crown. Bloody Republicans.
      All Papism and wanking and blowing people up. They'd have
      taught the swine a lesson, the old regiment. The way they did
      to Grivas and his thugs. The Colonel sipped, humming,
      remembering Grivas. A blazing hot July day in Limassol, three
      Land Rovers overturned and a Centurion set on fire, but after a
      single grenade tossed into the cafe there he was, their
      so-called bleeding Commander in person. No Geneva Convention
      rubbish with that fellow. Worse than the Irgun he was, not much
      better than the Nazis--all due credit, though, Jerry was a
      damned fine soldier. The Colonel raised his glass to Jerry's
      undeniable qualities.
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "Damned fine soldiers," he shouted, then drank, distracted from
      the gambolling girleens by memories of Arnhem and his first
      sight of Berlin, '45. What a bloody waste that was. Those
      German <em>madchen</em>, for a start. Why didn't they have any
      of them in the school? All blokes, bar the dagoes. Bottoms
      up--then, suddenly, down. When the Colonel came to, he realized
      he was lying on the floor. It had come on with the force of a
      .45 in the face, and it was more than drunkenness, that was
      certain; for one thing, there was no feeling at all on his left
      side, except for a residual tingling up and down his leg...a
      stroke, he thought, trying to say it aloud, but nothing came
      out, only spit. Bloody hell, he swore, inwardly. Six campaigns
      in every war zone from Juno to Jerusalem without anything worse
      than a bullet in the ankle and here he was, lying on the floor
      in his office, dribbling like a moron. He clawed with his right
      hand and hauled himself along the floor inch by inch like a
      beached walrus. Finally he got over to the telephone and lay
      there, wheezing, forcing himself to go through the
      alternatives. Not Caroline, that wouldn't do, he thought;
      anyway, she's at those people's house playing bridge. Can't
      have the coppers in here with the evidence spread out across
      the desk. Who the blazes can I trust, he wondered. Got to find
      someone who won't blow the whistle about the photographs. A
      warm numbness tingled gently in his left arm and leg and he
      fought against the desire to pass out. Got to find someone, he
      urged himself. What about Nolan? Good chap, Nolan...next to the
      phone was a list of the teachers' home phone numbers. Grunting
      and gasping, the Colonel levered himself up and grabbed at the
      phone. It crashed, jangling, to the floor. Through the blur he
      instructed his still-obedient right hand how to find the
      number--how to tap it out on the buttons (left, right, left,
      right)--how to dial--Nolan, stout chap--bit of a soloist
      himself--only man I can trust...
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      When Myles answered the phone he heard a wordless yammering on
      the other end. He thought, illogically, of Clare: since
      returning home, he'd sat at the window in a Clare afterglow,
      listening to Schubert on the stereo and imagining an Alpine
      lake in misty autumn, himself and Clare strolling along
      lakeside promenades, she in circa 1900 ladies' costume (hat,
      flowing dress, parasol), he in the gents' equivalent (top hat,
      walking stick, tails), a paddle steamer casting off, plunging
      mountains across the water. Was she phoning, he wondered, to
      share identical dreams with him? But the voice yammered on and
      he knew it wasn't Clare.
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "Mollam," said the voice. "Ah ad drogue."
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "Who is this?"
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "Gunnel. Gunnel Ainbum. Commup ide away."
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "Jesus." He's pissed, thought Milo. "Is that you, Colonel?"
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "Ah gorse iss bloody me. Ah ad drogue. Hoy ub."
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      He actually sounded worse than pissed, as if his mouth were
      full of marbles, resulting not in fruity elocution but its
      opposite..."Listen Colonel, this is no good. I have it. We'll
      use a code. Just go ah once if you mean yes, twice for no.
      Ready? Now. Are you at home?"
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      The strangled bellowing of 'Ah,' first twice, then once,
      conveyed the Academy as the stricken man's whereabouts. Myles
      mounted his bicycle--seldom used since the accident he'd had
      six months before--and labored up Toole Street to the school.
      When he got to the east wing, the office door was open and the
      Colonel was sprawled face down on the floor, next to the
      unhooked telephone. He twitched as Myles turned him over onto
      his back. His face was pink, with patches of white.
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "Onna deshk," he said.
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "We'll get the ambulance first, sir. Just lie calm, now."
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      The Colonel flailed in the air with his good arm, pointing.
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "Onna deshk," he bleated. "Hide."
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      Myles went over to the desk and saw the girls.
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "Bloody hell," he said.
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      The Colonel was taken to the Stella Maris hospital. Mrs.
      Rainbird, summoned from the third rubber at the MacIlwaines,'
      burst unexpectedly into tears at the sight of her husband in a
      blue hospital bumfreezer, his mouth awry, staring wildly at the
      news in Irish on an enormous TV. The doctors soon warned her
      away, to her relief. Edward had few qualities, she thought, but
      he was an old soldier and it was a sour trick of God's to do
      him in like this and make him dependent on men and women young
      enough to be his grandchildren; still, she had to admit
      (guiltily), it was a relief not to have him around all the
      time, like a rehearsal for the day when she wouldn't have him
      around at all, except for the smells of pipe tobacco and
      whiskey and old socks that had become as much a part of their
      house as the four walls themselves. Free on probation, Mrs.
      Rainbird began making plans for that distant day--distant,
      according to the doctors at Stella Maris, who told her on
      Sunday afternoon that the prognosis was good, with a minimum of
      whiskey and a long rest somewhere in the sun.
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      * * * * *
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      With the chief disabled, the future of Interworld Academy hung
      in the balance. Colonel Rainbird had run a one-man show,
      dismissing four assistant directors in the first two years of
      operation and thereafter relying on himself. There was no
      designated substitute, but on Monday Mrs. Rainbird telephoned
      Myles. The Colonel, she said, wanted him to fill in.
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "But I don't know the first thing about administration,"
      protested Myles.
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "Nonsense, Mr. Nolan. Neither does my husband. So long as the
      bills are paid and the lights are turned on, the school can
      muddle through."
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "I have absolutely no experience."
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "Experience not required, Mr. Nolan. Edward insists on having
      you and that, I am afraid, is that."
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      Too bloomin' right, thought Myles, or the old goat might have
      another stroke worrying about his girlie pictures and whether
      he, Myles, was the right man to keep the secret.
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "All right, Mrs. Rainbird. I suppose I have no choice. I just
      hope the Colonel doesn't regret it."
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "Certainly not. Anyway, we're going to spend some time with a
      cousin of his in Nassau, once he's on the mend. Enough time for
      you to make a permanent position for yourself as Staff
      Co-ordinator."
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      Thus did Glory, unsought by Myles, seek him out. All day
      Monday, he and Mrs. Rainbird went over correspondence and
      unpaid bills, readying things for the first full working day
      without the Colonel since the Academy's opening in 1972.
      Schedules had to be set, letters written, supplies ordered.
      Christ, thought Myles, I'll be spending the rest of my life in
      this hole. On the other hand, Mrs. Rainbird assured him of a
      dramatic increase in his pauper's pay, to be effective
      immediately. Larger and handsomer houses than the bungalow on
      The Parade insinuated themselves into Myles's mind; a car, too,
      possibly holidays in the South (Provence, Italy). After a day's
      reconnaissance work, he went down the hill to tell Clare. It
      wouldn't hurt his chances there, he reckoned, being a man with
      prospects.
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      Clare's front door was opened by jolly Ben Ryan. A glass of
      wine was in his hand.
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "Blow me down, it's old Myles," said jolly Ben.
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "Hello, Ben. I thought you were in Dublin."
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "I was. Now I'm here. Was it Clare you were wanting, was it?"
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "It was. But if there's some kind of hooley going on in there,
      I'll not intrude."
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "Hooley yer granny. We're having a wee drop. You know, she's a
      game girl, Mac Hen is. Full of life."
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "She is that." Between Myles and jolly Ben stood the ghost of
      Steve Jablonski. "Rainbird's been taken ill."
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "So I heard. Stroke, was it?"
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "It was."
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      Ben Ryan was leaning against the doorjamb, smiling what Myles
      interpreted as a smile of triumph. Music started up in the
      background: a violin, followed by more violins. Clare was in
      there, thought Myles, undressed or damned near, probably
      half-pissed as well. The whores.
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "He's asked me to be Acting Director," said Myles, letting Ben
      have it between the eyes. "Starting tomorrow."
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "Has he now, well that's grand. Listen, why don't you come in,
      we've some pretty dramatic news too."
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      From inside the house, Clare's voice rose above the melting
      strings.
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "Ben? Who's that?"
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "Ah, it's only the Acting Director of Interworld Academy,"
      shouted Ben, over his shoulder. Myles turned and walked down
      the path to the street. Behind him he heard Clare and Ben Ryan
      calling his name. In his heated imagination it sounded as if
      the call were being taken up by other voices, the whole
      neighborhood crying out for Myles, but he strode manfully on,
      aloof to all blandishments. Dramatic news, was it? Damn the
      woman and damn Ben Ryan, that womanizing jackeen with no more
      culture in him than a stevedore. To be Acting Director seemed a
      trifling thing compared to the perfidy of Woman. Not to mention
      that of alleged friends. Mother of God, raved Myles to himself,
      I might as well have done with it. Just go into a monastery and
      think of sin.
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      * * * * *
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      On the last afternoon of the bank holiday fewer Dublin families
      were on The Parade, but the townspeople were there, old and
      young and in between. Myles, as a longtime resident, recognized
      many of them. There was Mr. Delaney, the turf accountant, arm
      in arm with vast-bosomed Mrs. Delaney. Frank Tuohy from the
      Peat Board passed by, alone, head bowed, dreaming no doubt of
      an Ireland paved from Antrim to Kerry with peat briquettes.
      Jack Norton and his wife Rose, both liberal lawyers, and the
      three little Norton horrors, two of whom had loosened the front
      wheel struts on Myles's bicycle and caused him to be catapulted
      into Mrs. Harrington's garden next door (Mrs. Harrington,
      taking the incursion to be a sexual advance of some kind, had
      attacked Myles's inert body with a broom); since then Myles had
      cut down on his cycling. He nodded to the adult Nortons, who
      nodded back. The brats stared, remembering.
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      Although in his capacity as acting director he had work to do,
      Myles also had a growling stomach and five pounds in his
      pocket, enough for a chicken pie and a couple of pints at
      Gallogly's, Donovan's being risky after Saturday.
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      When he arrived at Gallogly's, he paused at the door. Raucous,
      full-throated singing was coming from inside, and Myles thought
      he recognized one voice in the chorus. He opened the door.
      There wasn't an empty seat in the place, and the local hearties
      were packed in four deep at the bar. They were raising their
      glasses and rocking back and forth like courting bears,
      rhapsodizing in unison. At the far end of the bar was a stage
      beneath a banner that read, "Gallogly's Karaoke Nights With
      Tokyo Taka." Leading the singing from atop the stage, mike in
      hand like Frank Sinatra at Caesar's Palace, was Mr. Watanabe.
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "Oh, Babs the Babe," he trilled.
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "Oh, Babs the Babe," roared the working class.
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "She was a wench."
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "She was a wench."
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "Who liked the sound of love, oh yeah!"
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "Oh yeah!"
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      It was a cross-cultural love-in unmatched by the United
      Nations. Myles knew better than to intrude on a scene of such
      gladsome chumminess and decided to go up to The Quare Fella for
      his pint and chicken pie.
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>

    <div>
      The holiday was over. On Tuesday, Herr Hockenburg marched into
      class to find Clare sitting behind the teacher's desk, with the
      new Acting Director's pencilled instructions in front of her.
      Myles deemed it a fitting punishment for her errant ways.
      Himself above mere language instruction, he now presided over
      Colonel Rainbird's desk with a mountain, or knoll, of paperwork
      in front of him: letters to be answered, phone calls to be
      made. Mrs. Rainbird visited on her way from the hospital to the
      hairdresser's; otherwise, Myles was left alone. He surprised
      himself with his own efficiency. After writing five letters, he
      checked the student roster, tracked down three truant Italians
      and ordered a dozen textbooks from a Cork warehouse. At noon he
      went into the garden for a smoke. October was ending balmily.
      The scent of peat and burning autumn leaves hung in the still
      air. A ferryboat was moving slowly out to sea from Rosslare
      Harbour. As Myles was taking the last drag on his cigarette,
      Clare Machen came around the corner, walking fast. Acting
      Director or not, he couldn't prevent his heart from skipping a
      beat at the sight of her. She looked grim.
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "Myles Nolan, you're a right gawm. Did you know that?"
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      Myles nodded, having nothing to say. Clare came up to him and
      folded her arms.
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "Why didn't you tell me you'd been named Acting God?"
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "Well," said Myles.
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "Ach. I know you came over to tell me, but why did you walk
      away like that? Because Ben was there?"
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      Myles shook his head, dumbly.
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "Did you think we were having it off or what?"
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "Having it off?"
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "Hadn't you the least notion why Ben was there at all? I
      suppose not. You didn't give him the time to say anything. He
      was there with his fiancee. He'd been around to your house but
      you were out so he decided to come share the good news with me.
      And she's a grand girl, so she is. We'd have had a party if it
      hadn't been for you skelping off like that. They're to be
      married in April, but the dear knows Ben wasn't too pleased at
      the way you carried on, so, Acting Director or no blooming
      Acting Director, you'll be lucky if you get invited at all."
      She took a breath. "Well. I suppose I should congratulate you
      on your ascent to magnificence."
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "Oh, it's nothing much."
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      Nor was it, thought Myles. A champagne-like ecstasy bubbled up
      inside him. Once again he'd been quite hopelessly wrong, only
      this time he thanked God for it.
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "I'll make it up to you," he said, taking Clare by the hand.
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "Oh, Myles."
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      "I'll change the schedules, for a start," he said, his eyes
      shining. "You won't have to teach Hockenburg again. I promise."
      He took both her hands in his, then frowned. "Well. No more
      than once a week, at least."
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      Oh, Myles, thought Clare. Tears welled, but laughter was close
      behind.
