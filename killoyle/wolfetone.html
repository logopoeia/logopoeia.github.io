      Guilt-ridden, too, was Wolfetone Grey, but no more than usual.
      In fact, he was having a relatively good time of it that
      Saturday night, with the kettle singing on the hob and a
      sweet-drawing pipe in his gob <a
       id="fnB0"
       name="fnB0"
       href="#fn0">[1]</a> and the murmur of the dying wind outside.
      Mrs. Grey was upstairs in bed, and that was no abuse to his
      peace of mind, nor was the absence of their daughter Doreen
      (she'd insisted on moving into a bedsit in the town the month
      before, "just to be on me own, like"--aye, she'd find out what
      <em>that</em> meant, soon enough). Television had never
      appealed to Wolfetone Grey, and reading was a bore, with few
      exceptions (e.g., anything by, or for, God), so the inner life
      he depended on was, by necessity, rich and varied, like the
      lush forests of New Guinea. As in those jungles, beauty and
      strength were combined with the objectionable quirks in
      Nature's humor: man-eating savages in the case of New Guinea, a
      passion for quasi-religious texts and anonymous phoning in
      Wolfetone's. Even now his hand reached for the telephone,
      stayed only by the thought of God, with Whom he was in regular
      communication--not by telephone, but via the prayer waves that
      emanated heavenward from the Grey house (suitably grey in
      color, with white edgings) on Lostwithal Road, several times
      weekdays and Saturdays and twice, loudly, on Sundays, in unison
      with the other congregants at St. Oinsias' in the town. At
      church, his prayers were generally bland, hewing to traditional
      themes: bless those we don't know-- help us along a bit--give
      us a boost now and then--sorry we're such sinners, etc. There
      was rarely time to allude to the phoning in those group chats
      with Him, but at home--one-on-one, as it were--Wolfetone was
      more direct, going boldly on the attack in anticipation of the
      Divine Schoolmaster's displeasure. There was nothing
      intrinsically wrong with calling up people he didn't know, he
      argued, not per se, like. Sure, it gave most of them the bit of
      a thrill, something to talk about the next day over the fence
      or the office desk, that kind of carryon: no harm there, eh? On
      the other hand--yes, he was forced to admit (reluctantly) that
      the impostures taken on by his telephonic personality were
      sometimes a bit much, sailing a little too close to the
      wind--all right, tantamount to deception if you wanted to be
      legalistic about it, i.e. lying, cheating and other
      naughtiness. The Sweepstakes promoter, for instance, flirted
      with outright fraud; he knew that, but he was the first to
      admit it, wasn't he? Anyway, hadn't he sent them both return
      bus tickets, at no small cost to himself (he might add)? All
      quite human, though, he reassured himself, jollily, before
      turning as in remorse to the Almighty and grovelling a
      bit--after all, He <em>was</em> the Almighty. <a

      "I work my arse off, begging your pardon," he bellowed into the
      ruffled night. "A rise of eleven percent last month and that's
      more than anyone else makes at the Hall bar that old coot
      Power--not as if he was underpaid, that's certain," modulating
      the volume somewhat. God listened; go on, He said, nudging.

      <em>[Here is recalled, for God's benefit and ours, the
      Sweepstakes prank in which, in the telephonic guise of a
      Sweepstakes employee, Wolfetone delivered to an obnoxious and
      not overly brilliant colleague a spurious first prize
      consisting of a steamy weekend with the sexy TV anchorwoman of
      that colleague's dreams</em>. <em>Then, back to the
      phones</em>.<em>]</em>

      "And wouldn't they have made the charming couple. Still,
      there's always another time, and while I'm about it, there's no
      time like the present--oh, come on," to an imagined tsk-tsk
      from the Heavenly Head. "This time it'll be as moral as all get
      out, just you wait and see." The fever of forbidden desire
      swooned through [Wolfetone's] frail frame as, with sweating
      palms, he picked up the telephone. On his lap was the
      directory, well-thumbed in the Killoyle area. Finger poised
      above the dial, he cleared his throat of tobacco oysters ten or
      a dozen times, then dialed a number, only to be accosted by an
      answering machine, bane of these nighttime japes. He tried
      again, and again, with the same result. It was nearly half-past
      eleven before an actual human voice spoke the magic word. <a

    <br />

    <div>
      "I beg your pardon? Mr. Power, this is Father Patrick MacCarthy
      of the Society of Jesus and the Redemptorist Mission. I do
      apologize for the lateness of the hour, but the hour is late in
      more ways than one, if you catch my meaning."

    <div>
      "Bloody nonsense," blustered Power, but the hook was in, the
      catch was thrashing its last.

       href="#fnB2">[3]</a> Just as well, if you ask me. While we're
      on the subject, that brings to mind something that happened to
      my Auntie Nuala, a while back--that's right, the one poleaxed
      by a tree in the Great Storm of '87--when she was the
      Taoiseach's mistress and living in comfort in a mews off
      Fitzwilliam Square. One morning, or early afternoon as it might
      be, she answered the phone in her boudoir to hear nothing but
      heavy coughing on the other end of the line. Hello, she says,
      waiting for the poor bleeder to get a hold of himself and state
      his intentions, like; but no sooner does he draw breath than
      he's off again, coughing and wheezing like the business end of
      a bus, and it due for the scrapheap. Well, says Auntie Nuala to
      herself (being a woman of firm opinions), this is no sort of
      conversation at all, and damn near hangs up the phone when
      something in the other party's coughing makes her pause, a kind
      of roaring high note you'd hope never to hear this side of a
      bullpen in the mating season. Suffering Jesus, says Aunt Nuala,
      the poor fella's in a bad way, and wasn't that the God's own
      truth! Before she could fasten her corsets it was all over, in
      a regular crescendo of hacking and spewing. Next thing Nuala
      knows there's a policeman on the line asking her if she's the
      one who left the open packet of twenty Players Full Strength by
      your man's bed! I ask you. Well, take my word for it, she hung
      up quicker than you can say Seoirse O Suilleabhain--which,
      coincidentally, was the dead man's name. You remember him:
      leader of the Fir Bolg parliamentary splinter group back in the
      late . . . ? or was it the early. . . ? <a
