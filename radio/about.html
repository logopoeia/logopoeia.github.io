    <h4>About the specially modified shortwave radio english broadcast preparation engine</h4> 
    
    <p class="normal">Output text produced by the specially modified shortwave
    radio English broadcast preparation engine is essentially a <em>simulation
    </em> of a broadcast instance of the specially modified shortwave radio
    English dialect. The output text is generated using a complex algorithm
    that attempts to precisely follow certain linguistic rules common to 
    observed instances of specially modified shortwave radio English.</p>

    <h5>The algorithm</h5>
    
    <p class="normal">Note that because no prescriptive grammar exists
    for the dialect, the algorithm is limited in that it represents a "reverse
    engineering" or reproduction of <em>some</em>, but far from all, of the
    linguistic rules of the dialect. However, the algorithm is based on a
    rigorous linguistic analysis of a very large sampling of recorded broadcast
    instances, and will for the most part generate text that is valid according
    to the observed rules, though certainly less complex than most actual
    instances.</p>

    <p class="normal">That is, an average actual broadcast recording of
    specially modified shortwave English is likely to contain a number of
    instances of rules that the algorithm at this point can't reproduce. (Some
    of the more obscure broadcast instances are in fact so complex that most of
    their underlying rules are not yet completely understood.) Overall, though,
    the specially modified shortwave radio English broadcast preparation engine
    development team believes that most users will be very satisfied with the
    results the algorithm generates.</p>

    <h5>Loan words</h5>

    <p class="normal">One noticeable feature of specially modified shortwave
    radio English is its occasional use of "loan words" from non-English
    languages, including (sometimes) the use of words that are themselves
    concatenations or combinations of terms from multiple languages. The
    algorithm attempts to reproduce this feature of the dialect. However, the
    development team currently views this as the most problematic part of the
    algorithm and wants to warn users that it can sometimes produce
    unpredictable transient results&#160;-- including, on occasion, generated text
    that is predominantly in another language. These invalid transient results
    are fairly easy to spot, however, and you generally need only reload the
    results page to eliminate the transient results and produce valid text
    instead.</p> 

    <h5>Why "seed text"?</h5>

    <p class="normal">The development team initially created the component of
    the engine that generates random ready-for-broadcast text. But some users
    who participated in an early field test of the engine found the random text
    vaguely unsatisfying, as did some members of the development team. Then it
    was suggested that the team could enhance the engine by adding a component
    that manipulates a passage of standard English "seed text" to produce
    ready-for-broadcast text that "looks like" or seems to "mean" something
    similar to the standard English input. The team quickly realized that
    developing such an engine would be quite possible and that the output it
    generated might in some ways be more interesting than the random text. So,
    after several months of additional development, the "seed text" component
    was added and the Web interface to the engine was made publicly available,
    basically in the same form in which you see it now.</p>

    <p class="normal">Note that use of seed text does not turn the specially
    modified shortwave radio English broadcast preparation engine into a
    "translation engine". Its underlying algorithm can in fact be altered in
    such a way that, based on the same seed text, it would produce a very
    different instance of the dialect than the instance it currently produces
    for that seed text. It's even possible that two different passages of
    standard English used as seed text could each produce identical instances
    of specially modified shortwave radio English (though this would be very
    difficult to actually demonstrate).  Thus, it makes little sense to speak
    of "translation" between specially modified shortwave radio English and
    standard English (or between the dialect and any other language, for that
    matter).</p>

    <p class="normal">In fact, by its very nature, specially modified shortwave
    radio English is fundamentally untranslatable. The rules of the dialect do
    not require that individual words have any absolute meaning&#160;-- only a
    "sense" relative to the other words within the instances in which they
    occur. Taken as a whole, an instance of the dialect can't really be said to
    "mean" anything, because unlike most other languages, the dialect does not
    have as a purpose the idea of "conveying meaning".</p>
    
    <h5>Future development</h5>

    <p class="normal">The team continues it analysis of the dialect and will
    eventually make its research results available to the language community
    for review. However, the team also feels strongly that there is a value to
    making the initial results of their research&#160;-- in the form of the
    current specially modified shortwave radio English broadcast preparation
    engine&#160;-- available to the general public. The team will of course
    continue to refine the engine as their knowledge of the dialect increases.
