    <h3>The Logopoeia &reg; Family of e-staff Automation Solutions</h3>


    <p>Like many other leaders in the industry, you've already
    tried all the traditional cost-cutting approaches: multiple
    rounds of RIFs, out-sourcing development and QA testing to
    India, holiday shutdowns, etc.  But you're finding that
    it's not enough, and you're looking for other areas of the
    business to trim.</p>

    <h4>Chop at the Top</h4>

    <p>Well, let's face it: the portion of any software company
    where the most fat resides is right there at its top-heavy
    head &mdash; the executive staff. But, until now, you've been
    reluctant to make cuts there because you rely on your
    executive staff to deliver some <strong>strategically
    important work products</strong>, namely:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>descriptions of concepts and initiatives to
        "drive the business"</strong> &mdash; you know what I
      mean: the kinds of seemingly signficant but ultimately
      meaningless words and phrases you need to fill press
      releases and morale-boosting
      this-is-what-we're-all-working-towards internal
      presentations and e-mail messages to your (remaining)
      employees</li>

      <li><strong>announcements and presentations about periodic
        reorganizations</strong> &mdash; which, though they almost always
      simply amount to a few things just being renamed (again) and
      a few people in upper management being shuffled around a
      little (again), serve an important role: they make it
      <em>seem</em> like something new and thoughtful and
      ambitious is happening</li>
    </ul>

    <p>So far, you've found that the only way to get these
    important work products created is to haul in a a truckload of
    vice presidents and directors, and set them free on
    the company to do their magic. You probably didn't even
    realize that there might be a better way. Until now.

      <h3>Introducing Software Executive in a Box &reg;</h3>

      <p>Software Executive in a Box is Logopoeia's flagship
      product &mdash; the industry's first Automated Corporate
      Communications Solution (tm).</p>

      <p>With Software Executive in a Box at your disposal, you're
      freed from the need to recruit and compensate actual
      executives to develop strategic concepts and initiatives to
      drive your business, because it is a <strong>fully
        automated solution</strong> for reliably and
      consistently producing corporate communications that
      independent laboratory tests have shown to be
      <strong>every bit as significant-sounding yet every bit as
        meaningless as the real thing</strong>.</p>

      <p>Software Executive in a Box has enabled major software
      providers around the world to make dramatic cuts to their
      executive talent pool, resulting in huge cost savings (and
      often in significantly improved corporate
      communications). It has established itself as the  
      software industry's premier Automated Corporate
      Communications Solution (tm), and radically reduced the
      costs involved in "going through the motions" of
      appearing to be making important business decisions and
      breaking new ground.</p>

      <p>But now, Logopoeia has found a way to reduce those costs
      even further...</p>

      <h3>Reorg in a Box &reg; Arrives</h3>

      <p>After months of intensive development and testing,
      Logopoeia is now poised to release a solution to complete
      the second half of the executive-staff work-product
      equation: <strong>Reorg in a Box</strong>.</p>

      <p>As a result of conducting extensive research to learn how
      best to meet and anticipate the software industry's current
      and future executive automation needs, Logopoeia's market
      research team made an important discovery: there is an
      overwhelming need in the industry to automate not just the
      corporate communications that executive management teams
      produce, but also the generation of the other key work
      product they provide: announcements and presentations about
      periodic reorganizations.</p>

      <p>With the need identified, Logopoeia's engineering team
      set to work developing a best-of-class solution to meet it.
      The result is Reorg in a Box.</p>

      <h4>What it Does</h4>
      <p>In a nutshell, once installed, what Reorg in a Box does
      is to simply run as a background process, and then at 
      a specified user-configurable interval (the default is 6
      months), it wakes up and starts to automatically generate
      all the important "collatoral" associated with high-level
      company leadership reorganization: org charts, Powerpoint
      presentations, e-mail announcements, etc. In essence, it
      simply gives the
      <em>appearance</em> that an important top-down company
      reorganization is taking place.  But since studies have
      shown that the work lives of most employees in most
      companies are never significantly affected by such
      reorganizations, chances are that the bulk of your employees
      will never realize that a reorganization hasn't actually
      taken place! Yet, they'll feel the same sense of
      inspiration and confidence that the executive team is hard
      at work trying to fine-tune the management structure to make
      the optimal use of the available resources and best meet the
      needs of your customers.</p>
      <p>The Software Executive in a Box/Reorg in a Box
      combination is a complete e-staff automation solution that
      will dramatically cut your executive staffing costs
      regardless of the size of your company. And innovative
      licensing terms are available that enable the solution
      to grow with your business.</p>
