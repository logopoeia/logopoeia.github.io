    <p>Logopoeia is making Software Executive in a Box &reg; and
    its source code freely available to the software development
    community because, well, because we have to.</p>
    
    <p>You see, although it was the Logopoeia product marketing
    team that made the important conceptual leap of realizing that
    the application code could be developed into a product for
    replacing software executives, the real work was done by other
    people: Doc Searls and Charles Roth. Software Executive in a
    Box is based on an open source Javascript application they
    developed and called <a href="http://www.buzzphraser.com/"
      >BuzzPhraser</a>.</p>

    <p>The Logopoeia product development team made some
    refinements to the word lists in the Javascript source for the
    application and put it into a <a
      href="software_exec_in_a_box.js">separate file</a>.
    That's the main bit you'll need to grab if you want to develop
    a Software Executive in a Box offering to
    compete with Logopoeia's.</p>
